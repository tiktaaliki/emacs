;;; Commentary:
;; This library advises org-cite functions that don't act like I think they should.

;;; Code:

;; there is an alternative to put #+org-cite-global-bibliography: nil in the
;; file but I don't like it. I think this is more consistent with using local
;; properties to supercede higher level properties.
