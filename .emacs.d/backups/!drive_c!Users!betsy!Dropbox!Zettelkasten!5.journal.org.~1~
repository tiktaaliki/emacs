- started lexapro
**** 8/19
Feeling strangely disconnected. I thought that the Lexapro was doing its thing yesterday but I had also taken adderall and was hoping it was the Lexapro and not the adderall. But today maybe indicates that it was indeed the adderall. 

Although, maybe not. I still got stuff done today, but not enough.

***** journal
- Kind of mad at James again. Or maybe just have hurt feelings. Or am feeling unimportant. 

I had a dream the other day involving a lot of drama. It was me being unable to find James and hearing he went off with another girl. I just felt so unimportant. 

What does all this mean? 

And this morning I came into the bedroom while he was sleeping and kind of looked at him affectionately. He opened his eyes and said, tanger doesn't open till 10. I was thrown off by the fact that his first reaction upon seeing me was to assume I was there to harass him into waking up. That kind of hurt my feelings. On the other hand, he's injured and is maybe cranky. 

And now he's going over planning his trip with his mom when we were supposed to go to tanger.

**** 9/1
- pd started
- depressed
**** 9/2
- still feeling somewhat depressed
have started playing games again -- cooking dash

Lexapro makes it easier to reflect on my emotions and assess knee-jerk reactions 

What does it mean when I'm depressed? 
- negative thoughts 
- needy? Am I needy when depressed? 
- I need to find a therapist and understand these conflicting emotions.

  I thought I inserted a note here, but I think I lost it when emacs crashed.
  
  Just musings on how I've been feeling much more productive in just these past 2 days. The key, of course, is having it become a regular thing, not just 2 days of working goodness. However, I feel that these past 2 days represent some sort of shift. It's been easier for me to wake up in the mornings. In fact this morning, I got up at 9 and saw no reason to go back to sleep.

  Feeling blah, yeah? Who knows. 
  
  I feel like I was so happy last week. It's so weird how easily everything can come crashing down. Resilience? I can't seem to maintain my sense of happiness when one thing goes wrong. I can't seem to handle when James and I fight. It seems that there's this binary of good or bad, and I can't see the shades in between or understand that it's a moment.

- 12:07 Feeling all jittery. Woke up with pounding headache, took some excedrin,
  and now all that caffeine is doing stuff. Have been having super weird and
  negative dreams. Negative dreams about James. Why? OTOH, not feeling all that
  contemplative.
- Fritz is out and about. Tried lavender essential oil + water spray
  today...will see if it works in the long term, but seems to be effective in
  getting him to not jump up on the table.
- Trying to get organized. Trying to get my life on track. Story of my life at
  this point. I think emacs has really helped in that regard--not that I've got
  my life together at this point or anything, but it helps to be able to have
  one place to store all my information that I use regularly. And that is easily
  accessible. It's also liberated me from the phone. Slowly I am building this
  thing. 
- I definitely need to start making money...
- Today I accomplished:
  - cleaned the desk area
  - ran the dishwasher & put away dishes
  - made tuna
  - nothing much else...

7:19 AM 
Past 2 nights were the first time in a long time I haven't had traumatic or
repetitive dreams about coordinating DEEP, or trying to find a place to
live/stay. My dream last night did contain moments of stress, but they were
different somehow, and that in itself was a relief. 

Constant themes in my dreams: 
- bathroom
- elevators
- subway
- KEEP-D
- food / shopping
- high school
- college, the application process
- my living situation

Sometimes I feel trapped in these themes. Waking up every day out of a night
consumed by trying to find a place to live, or trying to find that secret room,
or trying to find a bathroom...or trying...these are all dreams in which I'm
trying to do something and it's this endless struggle. And everything I try to
achieve is thwarted somehow. And last night, even though I do remember some
moments of stress or struggle, they didn't necessarily have these elements of
constant striving and failing. I don't think they did, anyway.

***** 1:13 am
I am so enraged, almost in tears. I just wrote this on my facebook page: 

I am so tired of white folks telling POCs how to organize and liberate
themselves. Why not check yourself and ask, have I been doing the necessary work
as a white ally to talk to and organize my fellow white folks? Historically,
unity between white workers and POC workers has been successfully fractured by
the ruling class by appealing to and invoking racism. Every day POCs experience
violence at the hands of well meaning white people. Stop telling us that our
experiences are secondary and that we need to put aside our differences and work
together, and see what you can do to bridge that gap yourselves.

The gall and the ego. It was powerful to see so many people at the march, but
there were so many incidents that just reminded me how difficult it is to work
with white people. And every time a white person said something to me that
triggered that feeling, I thought, where are our white allies? What have they
been doing? That fucking group that gathered at Tracy's place last week--all
these white people talking about how to organize and reach more POCs. Fuck you.
Organize white people. Antiracism is class warfare. Antiracism work is work to
remove the divisions of capitalism to unite workers. 

Sitting there listening to those white folks just talk about how copwatch is
volunteering and shit...the folks I met in copwatch are a thousand times more
committed and militant than you are. 

Left Voice wrote an article criticizing the Movement for Black Lives. And its
like, why? Why is that your target? This is a movement that is radicalizing so
many black youth and other POCs, and you sit there and tell them that they're
doing it wrong? Organize your fellow fucking white people. 

Hyun and I were talking on the subway today of the magnificent ability of white
people to think that they are blameless in whatever the topic at hand is. It's
always those other white people. Take some responsibility. Are you fighting
racism in your daily life? I'm still so mad. Stop trying to figure out how to
"educate" POCs, and how POCs should behave in this oppressive system to be
ideologically proper, and WORK ON THE WHITE PEOPLE. 

***** 9:35 am
I slept and I'm still enraged. Contrary to the previous two nights of sleep, I
did not sleep peacefully. I had angry dreams and I woke up angry. This is the
impact of how we carry the violence we experience with us, how it comes to
permeate our being, the amount of thinking done about this issue. And white
people--no. No self reflection on their own parts. 

I came to DC hoping to feel energized, and I just came away with yet more
examples of why I can't work with white people.

6:33 PM Just had the wackiest dream. I don't know why it seemed so much realer
than other wacky dreams, but it did. The last part I remember before waking up
is that I was trying to get in touch with Young-taek. Old WSB! In the dream, I
had had his child (who was a cat...) and had mentioned it in an email when it
all happened, but nothing ever came of it. I guess I was starting to feel
guilty that my cat child might not have the opportunity to know his father, so
I reached out to him again. To do so, I had to find his email address, and I
found it in a bunch of old emails. And, in my dream, his reaction to my news
about his child was a bunch of emojis to the gist of NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
WHAAAAT?????????? Seriously.

Another part of the dream was me trying to prepare for the next KEEP-D trip,
probably rooted in the fact that I'm now starting to prep for the next KEEP-R
trip. Things about blankets, and how to phrase the request email. 

Also something about a gas station that was cat-specific. And in my head, I was
like, I should go to only this gas station, cuz they're a cool gas station to
have this cat theme.

Not feeling it today. Also a little too full. Maybe thats part of it. Just not
focused. 

Feelings about working at CVS? I am conflicted, I admit. Part of me is like, a
bit embarassed at working here. Just because I'm doing the same thing I was
doing 16 years ago when I was in college. But then another part of me is happy
to not be in an office job anymore.

**** 7:11 PM Thoughts about work
How am I feeling? I almost cried at work today, but it felt somewhat unusual.
Like, I don't know why what happened made me about to cry. I think I get upset
when I feel I'm doing well and I'm suddenly told I'm not. And then I get upset
if this interpretation is invalid (for example, Lauren wanted me to help her
with phones. I thought I was helping her with phones, because I picked up every
time the phone rang with "one pharmacy call." And so I'm doing that, and then
she says again that I need to help her with phones. I say that I am, and she
kind of yells and says that there's a ton of ppl on hold. And I got both upset
and mad because hello, no one ever told me how the phones worked. I get that
it's not super complicated, but I thought those people on hold were all people
who were being helped.
