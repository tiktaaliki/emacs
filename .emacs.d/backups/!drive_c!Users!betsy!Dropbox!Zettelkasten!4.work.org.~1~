*** General meetings
**** January 29, 2017 (General membership meeting)
- maybe end early to go to rally
- oral history workplan
  - maybe the KEEP trip could collect some oral histories
  - how does oral history translate into collective action
- OC workplan
  - need to take care of self physically to adequately meet the challenges of the
    coming year. 
- Base Nation 
- DC inauguration debrief
  - JR: interesting b/c in close contact w/trump supporters...do we need to engage
    w/them? if so, how?. arbitrary, coordinated display of power
  - DK: realized how much of a bubble we live in...in NY hard to find proud
    trump supporters
  - RK: security was disturbing -- deliberate attempt to control parade route.
    confiscated tangerines.
  - HJ: protests were racially segreated. blacks and latinos participated in
    first one, but not so much in women's march. two totally different rallies.
    protesters were violent
  - We don't need to go to any more inaugurations
  - JYR:
  - RK: it was good to go. good to spend time with the folks we stayed with.
    allowed us to build among ourselves. it was significant to have so many ppl
    marching.
  - HL: Best part was spending time w/folks that went down together. CF Korea
    and mass outpouring against PGH and the election is going to be between Moon
    Jae In and Ban Ki Moon -- so has there been structural fundamental change?
    So yes, need to protest, but this is also opportunity for proactive
    organization of ppl to think about how to work toward fundamental change.
    What change do we envision and how do we make that happen? Who is having
    those conversations and how can we be part of that? 
  - JYR: Women's march made me realize--Korea marches were much better
    organized. We don't have these emergency plans. We should have stuck with
    POC contingent -- immigrant justice groups. Next time, need to belong to a
    similar contingent.

*** KPT
**** <2017-02-15 Wed> Call w/Sharon & Haruki
- Haruki -- primarily interested in involved in program and curriculum
  development. Wants to help maintain & grow KEEP. Maybe start w/learning how
  it's been workign so far, and developing ideas of how I can contribute further
  and grow further 
- Sharon: being on KPT has its own set of challenges. KEEP requires such a
  strong lengthy commitment that the more people there are, the easier it is to
  sustain it. Want to move burden away from OC's shoulders. What would the
  reality of KEEP be moving out of NDD. Language and accessiblity has been
  problematic for me, could contribute greater if more proficient or cultural
  resonance. Having other identities being part of KEEP would be really helpful
  in terms of program & curriculum development
- do a pre-program evaluation...see how participants have changed or grown
  through the program... 
- share google calendar w/haruki

**** February 9, 2017
- capacity of orgs on the ground 
- how does the situation affect the kind of site visits we would be planning
- given the situation, should participants have some famiilarity w/activism or
  would it be helpful to bring over brand new folks to the movement?
2/9 Conf Call Agenda DRAFT

***** Check-ins:
Name
Preferred Gender Pronoun
How have you been involved with keep.
Any other brief intro you want to share.
Describe the sky and weather where you are or the last time you went outside. 

Sharon: she/he, name. KEEP in 2010, keep-d in 2015. Moved to st paul MN, sky &
weather is mixed, cloudy/sunny...looking to build community in st. paul

Daehan: he/him, participated in KEEP-D in 2007, works for international strategy
center (try to make cxns with grps overseas...goal is to build int'l solidarity
as a way to fortify sk's social mvts). 14 deg fahrenheit. 

Wolsan: director of Korea peninsula & int'l affairs for Korean public service
and transport workers union. pgp is she/her and dongji, which is gender nuetral.
in charge of int'l work and unification work. union is largest affiliate of
korean federation of trade unions & organize in public institutions. has done
keep work off and on from korea. coordinated keep-d in the past. sky is clear!

Ara: she/her, with soobak in LA. went on KEEP in 2014 & soobak is getting more
involved in planning keeps. 80 degree weather! 

***** Is a 2017 trip feasible and viable? 
- would be targeting keep alumni, people who have experience with movement work.
- WS: could come anytime...may day would be best time to come b/c it would
  be before the elections. be a big rally time. right now in a kind of
  intermediary phase...not same as height of candlelight protests but current
  phase: needing to think about what's next. good time to have conversations. if
  too early tho anytime wld be fine. november: anniv of jun tae il's
  death...always a major mobilization moment and in past few years has involved
  farmers. feels very  strongly about need to have conversations btwn korean and american progressive
  orgs, so if it was a higher level delegation...ppl based in organizations that
  cld go back and do work, could take time off to do some of the coordination
- DH: coming around may, lots of orgs would be really busy. But at the same
  time, ppl coming will feel a type of energy that might be difficult to find
  after the election. after the election, prolly will be lots of convos about
  the election, discussion about reforms (depth & breadth)...but who will be the
  major factor in these...the ppl or higher ups?
***** What are some orgs to work with and what do you think capcity is?
- WS: during elections, ppl will be really focused. but also ASCK is prolly
  reaching out to different types of grps, whereas DH and WS are more connected
  to social mvt orgs. there will always be somebody who can meet. regarding
  coalitions, major issues coming out of protests and anti PGH: 
  - independent media reform
  - regressive labor reform
  - gov't written textbook issue
  - Sewol
  - baek nam gi
  - THAAD
  - media blacklist (honorable mention)_
WS could reach out to all these grps. 
Meeting w/Sewol families wld be impt regardless of timing

- DH: most important thing is our ability to mobilize grps of ppl. ideally may
  or mid may...but after is good too. faster the better. 

WS: not too close to eelctions otehr wise everythign wld be focused on
candidates & not on issues. 

may day or after elections

under trump: militarism in east asia & trade are 2 major convos.
if KEEP could bring related folks, thinking about hwo to build collective
demands and straetgies around thoese issues. it's not just THAAD but includes
rearmament of jp, increasing burden sharing for USFK...what will it mean to have
Trump and (likely) Moon Jae In in Korea. Could def meet lots of grps.

state of the left
DH: 2 mvts happening. 
- (grassroots) massive organizing, trying to revive student mvt. goign on campuses and
  organizing ppl who've never been organized before. ppl are also coming out of
  woodwork, ppl who had been in mvt before and then were not. these are
  organizing opporunities
- (organizational) efforts at consolidation: it's going in that direction.
  candlelight protests not revolution but uprising. moment of massive political
  consciousness. how much you're able to organize before things return to status
  quo. how many can you involve before it dies down is a key question. 
- candleight protests did invigorate the left and will be based on organizing
  efforts...

WS: 
- agree w/DH. not rev'n, but uprising.
- some success in organizing and some success in bringing
- one of biggest tasks is to maintain the energy generated in the candlelight
  protests.
- regarding political factions: there's been a falure to bring political
  factions together other than to reach out to existing candidates. existing
  candidates are not left candidates. not really going to be contending in
  elections on a political level.
- w/in KCTU -- proposal to do a people's primary & have political factions to
  come together to choose a candidate. but proposal didn't pass, which
  represents the states of the left.
- the left remains split and has not been able to come together. despite this
  moment, these divisions have ment that haven't beena ble to take advantage of
  it. cf spain or greece. 

DH: 
- candlelight protests...biggest achievment is the notion that protests can make
  a difference....at some point they were so common and widespread...the idea
  that going to protests is how you're participating in democracy. mass
  character. stigma about protesting doesn't really exist anymore, ppl feel that
  it's their duty as a citizen. need to think about long term impacts of this.
- likely that after protests that calm down, status quo will begin to
  reemerge...question of what can be achieved from this...they didn't calm down
  after the impeachement motion. now the stakes have changed...300,000 is low
  whereas before it would have been high. 
- thinks ppl will not be satisfied w/just changing governments and will not just
  disarm. after MJI becomes pres, will be aware of teh energy of the candlelight
  protests

WS:
- RE: MJI - contradictions between neoliberalism and xx has led to populism.
  trump is left
MJI has not taken a position on THAAD.
good chance he will do some left populist things (which isn't the same as
systemic change). chaebol reform is a big question. of all ppl arrested in jail,
vice chair of samsung was let off....still won't touch the big chaebols. one of
the questions for the left in a MJI space: how to not fall into trap of being
satisfied w/some populist measures. 
- politicization has been happening but low level. ppl attending the protests
  have not been talking about systemic change. how to talk about more
  fundamental change in a way that maintains the energy. 
- this is why int'l dialogue is impt right now.
- ppl here would be interested in what folks in the US would have to say about
  trump. what is the political strategy in the US as well as strategic/tactical
  qtns about hwo to mobilize. bilateral exchange...ppl from US would also
  prepare presentations.
- it's the 30th anniv of 1987 mvt....june 10. july aug & sept, major labor
  mobilizations. 

WS:
-candleight protests have always had THAAD speakers...seongju ppl come to speak.
and have been trying to highlight it. but the reality is that the energy from
those protests is not going into the THAAD movement. february&march is v. impt
time regarding an agreement on a land...good representation of the level of
politicization...nto getting into fundamental questions like US korea
relationship...THADD protests are so much smaller
- MJI has also not taken a definitive stance on NK. straegic ambiguity. said he
  wld go to NK before goign to the US. supported sunshine policy...but b/c nk is
  now nuclear state, it's a different context. unless US/sk relationship
  fundamentally cahnges, won't be able to do much abt NK dialogue. at the
  moment, target needs to be US/SK relationship. it's bleak either way. 
DH:
-MJI is being ambiguous is b/c of the conservative backlash he expects. wants to
bring in liberals w/o alienating conservatives. not inherently conservative
(aside from neoliberal economic policy stuff) abt things like NK. doesn't want
to alienate conservative base who are also anti-park. 

Ara: timeline wise, may wouldn't work. planning a moim in may so wld be better

Gonji: part of soobak, have been talking w/ndd folks on how to start doing more
to coordinate the keep trips so it's more sustainable.  

ws & dh: both willing to help out whatever


***** Purpose of today’s call--to learn about the following:
Where are intersections of struggle to build upon?
What will be the capacity for orgs/group to host KEEP participants?
What are specific orgs to work with for site visits?
Baek Namgi coalition, 
Sewol coalition
the coalition formed to organise for Park's resignation (the main formation at the moment - although it is likely to have disbanded or altered by June.) 
Wol-san’s union….??
KCTU. 
Is there a specific role that KAs can play? 

***** Ideas for focus for trip content:
Building dialogue between progressive forces in Korea and US about meaning of Trump for E Asia - looking at policies towards the DPRK, KorUS FTA, THAAD/Asia Pac Pivot
Envisioning new forms of social movements and solidarity.  

***** Issues to consider:
7 hours of the Sewol.
Impeaching ROK’s first female president while fighting Korea’s misogyny?
Role of art and artists in resistance and struggle/protest.
Implications for the left, divisions among the left, is this an opportunity to consolidate the left?
What is the role of the left in this moment, given that it is not a revolutionary moment?

***** Updates:
ASCK is planning on a one-day conference.
Any other updates?

***** What needs to happen initially to make trip happen:
Find trip coordinators.
Identify a few people that are committed to being participants - will assess w soobak and other regions.
Would need to have an expedited application process.  

**** January 8, 2017 (call w/Ara and Gonji)
***** update on how everything's going soobak & moim and soobak & keep
- folks are down to be part of the planning process. need more information on
  what that wld look like concretely. not sure what it looks like. if we did a
keep together...
- doing a lot of internal work. haven't had capacity to do campaigns or anything....

up and down

***** we let them know that we're avail to help re: moim -- in what capacity do they see us helping?

what would be most useful in a collective space
how to build each other up...each group has different strengths

1st gen grp -- relationship to moim
why weren't they more involved

***** any interest in coordinating this year? 
patty could coordinate

- who we're reaching out to in regard to site visits
- shadowing...knowing workplan...

joining call w/daehan and wolsan

soobak - so cal organizinzed oppression breaking anti imperialist koreans 

down to help w/study groups...

**** 2016 eval notes
- did not meet most of our goals
- the strategic planning process took up the first half of the year, and then
  once we realized we needed to work specifically with orgs first, it felt like
  we gained more momentum.
- we had initially planned to have the moim be the 2017 KEEP activity, but we
  decided to plan a trip. Finding a coordinator seems to be the main thing we
  need to do.
- we had a lot of external logistical barriers, as well as me going through
  several different medications in search of something that would work well
- what is the connection with nodutdol
- KPT has been kind of invisible in Nodutdol BUT 
- there is interest in KEEP but there's no one involved with KPT process
- do more studies
- who can take legal responsibility for KEEP?
- we tend not to modify workplans when stuff happens
- what could oc have done?

OC Meeting (over google something) 12-5-2016


Agenda (feel free to add/edit)


0. Check-ins// setting up the agenda
Sharon: hung out with Ann (films) a few times, mother in law passed away. Got along. Met with kurt, haven’t reached out to Sungmi yet, but will. Went to seattle w cory for thanksgiving; saw jennifer kwon dobbs, who cared for catbaby. Talked to her about 
KEEP advisory committee - 


KPT report: so S and B have a proposal for a KEEP advisory committee- will hold KPT accountable to goals etc. a way to create a broader approach and a way to involve people who are interested but arent able to commit more than that. Will submit soon, maybe next week. Talked to james, who is committed and will help, tho christina from sangoksoo, committed to keep but doesn’t have capacity right now. Severl new members intersted in going on trip but too new to lead. James is planning to move to LA by fall 2017. So not sure what this means for the group.  
Talked to Ellen re hobak, and things seem positive, energetic, and they would definitely be interested in participating in KEEP and working on it, Ellen will be liaison. Soobak is working on the moim, and S and B will check in with them soon. Originally planned for Feb 17th but maybe that’s too soon. Hope it would be a forum where we could connect with potential keep folks. Hoping for SK trip in 2017, but may be different because of capacity - maybe different timing.  ASCK crowd will be going 3rd week of June, which leads into an international Korea conference.(theme is 1987 plus 30) While that might be early for KEEP, it would be a good time as June 15th activities and who knows what post PGH resignation activities will happen. JC suggests possibly connecting, Seyeon is there and Hosu can help maybe. And JC checked on english possibilities.  JT to follow up w Henry re ASCK sched etc. things moving with KPT.  End of this week for JT to report.
Possible coordinators: Mijin and Saeyoun? Ara or Gonji? Haejin? (hobak)


Re OC retreat in Jan (Jan 21 & 22 Sat/Sun) - only JC and JT, would be good if B, S and Danny encouraged to join in retreat. S agrees, as board member. Jan 21st is the date set for now, but also dependent on SJ’s mom’s departure from NY. see below


OHP report: 
Danny report= Nov 19th was great workshop. Before that had planned to do more stuff by the workplan, but given situation, it was a good workshop to end the year, about a dozen people, very productive. Made videos, sounds, props for the multimedia performance or even a video sample for the project. Now need to keep momentum going despite SJ being out for a while. Maybe do some meetings to bring newer people into, with less formal gatherings to introduce the project and what we hope to do in the next year. Do this in January? Goal is to get more people involved throughout the whole process, esp given SJ life and DK’s schedule. SJ and D didn’t discuss since Sol arrived earlier than scheduled. Will have to talk eventually, maybe this month - is open to talking with OC about it. Other possible people interested but not consistent - how to keep them. Rose, doug, sooyoung. no one yet has roles that commits them. So need to meet with these folks. Also need to plan for more collection of oral histories - needs to happen alongside the archiving, etc. idea was for 2017, was to focus on KA histories too. This was an idea, that came up around the discussions that Kyungjee led and there was an anniversary re the LA rebellion, and would have been good to do something around that. Need to revisit this concept. Was suggested that Rose Kim might be a resource. Have to evaluate capacity to do KA and Kwar stuff.  B talked to Hobak and they might be interestd in doing something around, maybe do something with Soobak. They have been doing some drum stuff together. Ellen and Patty were both at Standing Rock. so there seems to be possibility for them to work together on Saigu stuff.  JC also suggests viewing the Saigu movie (and the update as well), and possibly getting Dai Sil to come and talk (and eventually ask to borrow footage) maybe this could be a film screening and a kind of workshop. JT to check on TWN’s film on the issue. Possible idea for an event. In Jan if both B and Dan can come to retreat with some eval of past and hopeful plans for 2017. JT on suggesting possilibty of giving new people new work as hard to fit in within a plan that already has been set.  Danny will come up with a fuller report.  Thinks they can come up with a performance in a few months, though if they do more interviews  - but more realistically, mid year at the earliest. A capacity issue. jC: what if we do this as a Kwangju day event or June 25th event. Issue of state violence and repression of democracy. D: not thought about it yet. OC to help out despite not having SJ avail. Filipino restaurant - in woodside. There’s a huge open space in basement. Was pretty good to have events. Hyun will find out how much. We dont actually have budget for space rental, but can work around. 


Kim Chee Bowl report
B: fun, the two kids fun, unfortunate that new members didn’t come. That family is hoping we will be part of the demo on friday with dance. D’s neck is sore from his energetic dancing. JC also in pain. D talked to a few people - Rose, Jinnie Huh seemed progressive, though missed KEEP talk, her art is anti KJU, need to think about how to engage folks like that. B: alot of KAs who haven’t been in touch with progressive KA community fall into that route. Can be in touch w her, JC says be open to telling her what we’re about. Keep engaging w her. Her email is on the “family” list. Need to tell her about the friday protest. That D should reach out to folks like her to get her committed. D: need to set a meeting beginning of 2017 and get folks to commit. And at Dec 30th, OC can try to have conversations with some individuals about being part of it. Party will be for those who member wanttobes.  Possible plan -  JC avail 14,15,16. JT will get back to D. let’s meet before xmas.  JC  has time to brainstorm this week and those dates listed. JC can also do last 2 weeks of december.


Doug wants to become a member. Maybe didn’t go through orientation? B; thinks he should not be required to do it. JT agree. Doug said he would love to pay dues as a supporting member. Has to defend his thesis proposal and look for a job. 
Rose: has been around NDD since 2004, but doesn’t really know much about our history. She wants to be a supporting member and send dues.




No-THAAD - Korean American representative voice is needed 


James will make more stickers for friday protest. There’s some left i the office in the cabinet (for the party) 


3. General meeting/Year-end meeting (more of social or celebration)? 
Year end reflection - December 30 (Friday) - potluck // AAWW - Juyeon will ask for space; need to send it out a save the date. JC will ask Meejin and Danny to work on this. It will also be his birthday party. JC wants each person to talk about how this year has gone and hopes for 2017, end up with optmistic stuff. With active recreation. 


Give a little bit of time for Hosu’s new book (congratulatory) Dec 18th: is combo going away and book party. 
 
4. OC Retreat/evaluation and planning & plan for members’ general planning meeting in Jan. 2017?  (Danny, Betsy & Sharon should be invited on Saturday January 21 ) - Sukjong will communicate 
January 21 (Sat) 1-4pm - eval

**** <2017-02-13 Mon 20:00-22:00> Challenging Missile Defense in the Age of Trump
***** Ray McGovern:
- 1972 Moscow: Anti-ballistic missile treaty
- 1983:
- 2001: george bush got out of ABM treaty
- ballistic missile defense system can always be defeated by decoys.
***** JJ Suh
3 main points
- THAAD is part of arms race on Korean peninsula
- THAAD adds to global arms race (Russia, US, China)
- there are feasible alternatives

Arms race on SK peninsula
- US-ROK nuclear weapons: NK asymmetric capabilities to maintain a balance
  (troops near border and missiles)
- US-ROK Nukes + RMA (GWB adopted preemptive strike) - NK responded by adding
  nuclear capabilities 
- US-ROK missile defense - NK's countermeasures
  - US missile defense is attempt to undermine NK's defense capabilities and
    thus acquire first-strike capabilities
  - NK now developing countermeasures


Possible uses for THAAD
- Defense of SK peninsula: BUT:
  - that THAAD is for higher altitude (higher than NK short range missiles)
  - basing it in seongju, it wouldn't be able to protect Seoul
- THAAD as regional defense
  - can be used to defend against NK missiles aimed at Okinawa, Guam (more
    probable than SK defense)
  - effectiveness is questional b/c would have to be fired in ascent phase of NK
    missile launch
- THAAD to defend US continent
  - if NK has ICBM capabilities, could theoretically defend 

THAAD: detect missile launch
also can be used to detect EMP attacks (sattelite that carries nuclear bomb (or
EMP?) 

Eunha 2 flew over california

If THAAD fails to intercept ICBM or EMP launch, still useful b/c radar can track
and relay info to other MD systems in region 

Obama has said directly that purpose is to protect US mainland

NK has developed countermeasures to make MD systems ineffective. SO US & SK are
looking into developing first-strike capabilities. So in response NK is also
proposing first-strike capabilities. 

Global arms race
- China: 
  - radar covers China area. Strategic threat that undermines
US already has 2 THAAD radars deployed in Japan which allows triangulation with
3rd in SK

Obama built MD system in europe, mediterranean, romania. and now plans a new
type of MD system in turkey. Allegedly for defense against Iranian missiles, but
these plans went ahead even after nuclear agmt w/Iran. 

Existing MD systems can be used to launch cruise missiles against Russia and new
systems can be used to neutralize Russia defense capabilities.

MD in europe is a destabilizing factor. 

Both MD systems in Asia and Europe are meant to undermine China and Russia's
defense capabilities. 

What are alternatives?
- Arms control/freeze. 
  - would mean that US/ROK scale down/postpone/cancel key resolve military
    exercises and demand NK freeze nuclear tests. -> NK has indicated would be
    willing to entertain such a possiblity. 
- could lead to peace regime + nuclear weapons free zone (NK giving up nukes in
  return for guarantee) --> but what about libya?
- NK's behavior for past 20 yrs -- when US and SK has engaged, NK has responded
  by freezing/disabling nuclear program. 
- July 6 2016 Statement by NK
  - issued by cabinet spokesperson (as opposed to foreign ministry)....
  - denuclearization is "the injunction left by KIS and KJI," "the will of the
    KWP, the military, and the people who follow KJU")
  - 5 conditions to be met by US: (1-4 were part of prev agmts)
    1. nukes be opened to the public
    2. nukes and bases be dismantled and verified
    3. nukes not be introduced
    4. no use or threat of use of nukes
    5. "withdrawal of US troops holding the right to use nukes from south korea
       should be declared" --> interesting b/c not demanding withdrawal of US
       troops. significant weakening of NK's previous position. 

     
    


**** Dec 6, 2016 (THAAD discussion with SPARK)
- dec 4: pgh 3rd speech & apology. said would leave her potential resignation to congress. this statement came mostly from the power of the candleight vigils ppl have been holding every week. she didn't specify any details or timing. she also denied the criminality of her actions. thus only 1/2 victory
- will be harder to reach agmt due to ruling party dynamics. she's using this to extend her time in office. 
- impeachment: need 200 votes. 
- opposition parties are doing sit-ins to pressure saenuri
- dec 7, 6 pm:
  - opposition to pgh w/in saenuri
  - if she doesn't say anything by dec 7, 6pm, they will agree to impeachment
- candlelight vigil
dec 3 was 6th national
biggest in Korean history
2x as 1987 june uprising

ppl were really upset by this last talk/apology from pgh.

special investigation going on
there will be a congressional hearing
this is not the same as a legal impeachment hearing on constitutional court, but there are other impeachment options. 

if impeachment doesn't go thru, then saenuri may take longer in congress and try to override the situation. present different alternatives. and candlelight vigils may not persist. 

- 1500 orgs have created taskforce
- but ppl have diff opinions on what would happen *after* she steps down.
- progressive forces don't have a predominant role in this. 
- candlelight vigils are of everyday citizens
- SPARK's position:
  - civil society should take leadership instead of relying on political parties. ppl should participate in national taskforce mtgs
  - whole cabinet should step down once provisional cabinet is found
  - learning from june 1987 uprising -- need to come up with agreed-upon leaders to represent the people
  - political corruption and scandals should be thoroughly investigated. people's livelihoods should be key values by this new cabinet to form ppl's government
- a lot of progressive leaders are in jail. head of kctu is in jail (8-yr sentence). 
- how long will this go on? is this kind of civil society pressure sustainable?
  - b/c there'll be a congressional session on dec 9
  - there is a high probability that they will vote for impeachment. the next step will be the constitutional court. it is likely they will decide on impeachment. it is possible that she will step down. if the constitutional court
- THAAD
  - ministry of def has been working to bring thaad to korea, even with the current gov't issues
  - nov 15, said they would exchange seongju golf course. this will bypass any congressional hearing.
  - nov 23: they signed korea-japan general security military information agreement.
  - dec 6: they sent completed land survey of seongju-lotte golf course and announced that the title of the land will be transferred to ministry of defense by end of dec.
  - by beg of feb, believe that construction will commence
  - by aug, hoping that thaad will be operational
  - US officials comments re: THAAD
    - daniel russel: said they forsee no changes in major priorities of US_ROK military alliance, regardless of political dev in seoul
    - josh earnest -- wh presss secretary -- turmoil is internal political matter to sk so has no bearing on military alliance
  - thoughts that PGH is trying to ensure the rest of her term by making sure THAAD goes thru. A lot of the opposition party leadership have implicitly agreed
  - TRUMP -- possibility that the "pivot" will change? Not likely tho. They are trying to highlight NK missile threat in order to complete encirclement of China.
  - CHINA: tax investigation into Lotte in China. Interpreted as retaliation by China. But also small possibility that they will agree to THAAD deployment.
  - US missile defense initiated by Bush & RMH, and with strategic flexibility.
key: US wants to stay in East Asia. 

plans to struggle against THAAD
- lotte golf course shut down in mid-dec.
- transfer of title will be complete by jan
- then site will be "given" to USFK
- feb: planning and groundwork will start

- seongju villagers: trying to stop the land survey
- 150 ppl living in a village by the golf course. villagers created task force and are trying to stop entrance of military facilities
- kimcheon has a similar plan. since nov 30, every wed have been having rallies
- dec 21 – seongju resistance force is planning rally w/tractors and agricultural equipment facilities. buddhist org creating a peace bus tour so ppl can come in and help out.
- there is a national task force...

- PGH impeachment demand came from seongju ppl. this village has been traditionally conservative

- religious leaders are also involved
pgh approval rating 5% — in contrast: 
thaad  65% agree with thaad deployment

3 agents in thaad struggle
- seongju
- kimcheon 
- won buddhism

3 levels of struggle
- daegu/ulsan –> in charge of larger regional taskforce
- yeongnam and south and north kyeongsan province task force
- national level task force. 

these 3 entities have regular roundtable meetings

3+3 meeting happened in dec 5

won buddhism chapter heads are involved in each task force

won buddhists have been doing a continous 80-day sit-in in front of ministry of def
have 1.5 mill leaders(?) and are officially against thaad but not officially against pgh. have not said anything publicly

their believers are very conservative – there are a lot of internal conditions where they cxan’t say any anti-government or anti-us stuff

self-immolation is not their official policy, no actual plan to self-immolate. 

there is a sacred site close to the lotte golf course. if the site will be impacted

what can we do in the US?
- create public opinion about missile defense policy. demonstrate that it increases military spending and increases military competition between states. increases military tension. expends people’s tax money. demonstrate that this is purely for US military interest

korea-japan military agreement information sharing – is now being challenged in congressional hearings. 148 congressional reps have signed petition to annul this treaty. this agreement is only possible b/c of US pressure. If there is a withdrawal of THAAD, this military agreement can be easily challenged by congress

***** convo w/jennifer
         - [x] requests confidential --check is okay to discuss with oc?
         - [x] jennifer was her study coordinator
             - [x] julayne hadn't read the materials
             - [x] always wanted to talk abt adoption in sk
             - [x] post-keep, she revealed that she felt jennifer had talked down to her. "cowering in the corner" strong language. julayne felt she had been silenced.
             - [x] jkd doing adoptee nk research w/christine hong. felt strong ownership over the research.
             - [x] bringing it into npa meetings, demanding transparency
             - [x] worked against jkd, redbaited her. questions her politics re: pave. caitlin kee is willing to speak to us.
             - [x] her perspective on korean adoption isn't intersectional.
             - [x] with how she treated her hakseup, not convinced she is politically "adoptee exceptionalism" larger vision making
             - [x] her behavior killed npa
             - [x] anyone who participates in the kpt process, it would be about political solidarity.
         - [x] if julayne wants to participate, is that a dealbreaker?
         - [x] her b
         - [x] extent of her concerns
         - [x] what do you mean by "abusive"

***** convo w/ara
         - [ ] would rather not be paired with julayne
         - [ ] went through a yearlong process of trying to conflict resolution and mediate. gonji and ara mediated. it grew
         - [ ] conflict was political around campaign. couldn't take political criticism very well
         - [ ] undocumented -- had concern about adam's agency in the campaign. jenna and julayne took it personally, saying you're not adoptees.
         - [ ] process was messed up, silencing, couldn't say what she really wanted...dillon didn't want to hear them making excusing...shouldn't have talked about it at the collective

**** ppl who responded to KPT email

                        - [x] Gonji

                            - [x] I don't know what my capacity will be for the next year, but I'm super invested in the continuation of KEEP and would like to be part of the meetings depending on how much time/commitment ya'll are asking for.

                        - [x] JKD

                            - [x] I have limited capacity right now and couldn't take on a leadership role with KPT. That being said, I'm happy to share resources and provide input to support KEEP's sustainability.

                        - [x] Ara

                        - [x] Hosu

                        - [x] Julayne

                        - [x] Natalie

                        - [x] Eugene shared his thoughts

                            - [x] I think that building in continuity &amp; connection with both participants &amp; korean orgs is super important.

                            - [x] To maintain relationships with orgs/groups beyond keep trip....maybe thru continued, regular convos w/ certain korean contacts? Or begin them earlier, in prep for the trip? So the group can have some kind of personal repoire already? This might also help inform what kind of communication &amp; learning needs arise from both groups. But also, could be a scheduling nightmare... Maybe delegate reps?

                            - [x] Build projects together as a network of diasporic koreans in the us.

                            - [x] Maintain &amp; engage keep community. That's a lot, not sure on the hows, but possibly with events, political &amp; personal updates, maybe post study group(for things that may come up, interest that gets sparked, etc) or past delegates are invited to join study groups w/ current delegates. Having various past delegates' participation can help speak to the importance of studying, &amp; emphasize specific things that might be crucial to know in certain contexts. But will a study group be voluntarily popular? Unclear...

                            - [x] Keep delegation can be part new folks &amp; part returning folks to maintain continuity and not feel like it's a whole new group each visit. It is hard enough to introduce ourselves &amp; update each other in the limited time we have, but to then try to personnally connect then meaningully build off of that can be very daunting.

                            - [x] Stay longer &amp; work on a project alongside korean organizers.

                            - [x] Internship opps w/ korean orgs. So some can either stay on, or return at a designated time.

                            - [x] Paid coordinator &amp; study group leader positions! Cultural/political grants? Yearround fundraising?

                            - [x] Keep reunion gatherings! Maybe open to all past delegates, so it's one large group that grows each year...

                            - [x] Related nor inspired keep project instead of or along with reportback.

                            - [x] Or maybe keep is every other year, or one part is based here &amp; one part is based in korea...could tie into projects or internships thought.

                            - [x] Im just throwing down these intial thoughts as a very rough brainstorm. Totally take it or leave it, but i would happy to talk it out more in the future, if that is in any way helpful.

                        - [x] Haruki

* Grammar notes
coordinating conjunctions	Use commas to separate two or more coordinate adjectives that describe the same noun. Be sure never to add an extra comma between the final adjective and the noun itself or to use commas with non-coordinate adjectives.
	Coordinate adjectives are adjectives with equal ("co"-ordinate) status in describing the noun; neither adjective is subordinate to the other. You can decide if two adjectives in a row are coordinate by asking the following questions:
	        • Does the sentence make sense if the adjectives are written in reverse order?
	        • Does the sentence make sense if the adjectives are written with and between them?
	If you answer yes to these questions, then the adjectives are coordinate and should be separated by a comma. Here are some examples of coordinate and non-coordinate adjectives:
	He was a difficult, stubborn child. (coordinate)
	They lived in a white frame house. (non-coordinate)
	She often wore a gray wool shawl. (non-coordinate)
	Your cousin has an easy, happy smile. (coordinate)
	The 1) relentless, 2) powerful 3) summer sun beat down on them. (1-2 are coordinate; 2-3 are non-coordinate.)
	The 1) relentless, 2) powerful, 3) oppressive sun beat down on them. (Both 1-2 and 2-3 are coordinate.)

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am applying for the Pharmacy Technician position at CVS/pharmacy. I have 10 years of experience as a pharmacy technician. From 1994–2000, I worked at the Medicine Shoppe. Then, I moved to the Boston area for college where I worked at CVS/pharmacy from 2000–2004, first in Newton, MA, and then in Roxbury, MA. While working at CVS/pharmacy I earned my PTCB certification. 

My most recent experiences as an Associate Editor at the Community College Research Center and as an Editor at Yoon Editing have honed my attention to detail and communication skills. Previous to that I worked as an administrative assistant at the Community College Research Center and have excellent interpersonal and customer service skills.

I am seeking to change careers and would love to once again be part of the CVS/pharmacy team while I attend graduate school for library science. I look forward to hearing from you. 

Thank you for your time. 

Sincerely,

Betsy Yoon

Dear Ms Bridget Salvato,

I am applying for the Library Information Assistant position at the Richmondtown New York Public Library branch in Staten Island. I earned a BA in English from Boston College in 2004 and a Master of International Affairs from Columbia University in 2010. I am implementing a career change from editing and publication work to library science and would love this opportunity to gain hands-on library experience. 

In my six years as Associate Editor at the Community College Research Center (CCRC), I was responsible for preparing CCRC research for publication and dissemination, including editing, proofing, and formatting. This experience honed my attention to detail, as well was working efficiently and effectively within time constraints. I have over 10 years of editing experience and have excellent written and verbal communication skills. I also developed superb organization skills. For example, I created and maintained a large database of references to streamline the editing process. During my time, I participated in developing the website, which included cataloging CCRC's existing research from 1996 to ensure that our publications would be easily accessible to the public.

In my role as Co-Director of the Korea Education and Exposure Program (KEEP), run by Nodutdol for Korean Community Development, I have accrued 5 years of experience with community training, programming, and outreach. I have conducted workshops on Korean history and current events, outreached to college students and other interested parties, and maintained and developed the KEEP program. This program takes delegates (drawn from a nationwide applicant pool) to North and South Korea in alternating years. This past year, my co-director and I initiated a strategic planning process to fundamentally rethink and improve the program to meet the evolving needs of the participants and our hosts. Preparing for these trips includes a series of study sessions and workshops to prepare the delegates for the trip. 

I have spoken to many librarians regarding my plans to earn a degree in library science, and all have stressed the importance of practical experience. I am eager to learn more about the library system and would love this opportunity to serve both the New York Public Library and the community it serves.
