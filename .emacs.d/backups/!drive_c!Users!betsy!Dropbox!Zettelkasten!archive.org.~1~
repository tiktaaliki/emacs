** 4 pm for setup
** leave here at 2:30 pm
** set up playlist
** KEEP presentation
*** KEEP-R began in 1994/1995 
KEEP was created in 1994 by activists in NYC, LA, and Seoul who wanted to help build solidarity with and learn from the struggles for peace, social justice, and unification taking place in Korea. We believe these types of experiences are an important step toward understanding the history and role of Koreans here in the United States.

The mission of KEEP is to increase awareness of and strengthen the global movement for peace and justice on the Korean peninsula and in the United States and North America. Through building relationships and communities, KEEP seeks to broaden our understanding of and participation in the liberation struggles and unification of the Korean people.

We do hope that such knowledge will be a catalyst for a new generation of progressive activism and community leadership.

*** KEEP-D 
Began as an NDD project in 2001. 

*** From 2005, NDD was the primary organization of KEEP-R and KEEP-D

*** First adoptee on KEEP was in 2008 with JKD. Since then, the participant demographics have become more varied. In 2013, the KEEP-D delegation came up with 

*** today: mission statement:

1. Contribute to the growth of a sustainable international and national movement for peace and reunification in Korea in relation to the larger anti-war and anti-imperialist movements.
2. Build understanding and awareness among the general public and progressive forces about the ongoing US-DPRK conflict.
3. Continue to develop leadership for activists that identify as being a part of the progressive Korean/Korean-American community.
4. Bridge divisions created by age, language, and culture.

Hangout & prop making

Hi dongmuz! 

Some folk are going out to DC next week, and we thought it would be fun to have
a prop making / chant making session on Tuesday. ALSO, someone from the group
Rad Taiwanese LA, a sister org to Soobak, is going to be in town and we'll be
having dinner w/them at the office that day. 

Please let me know if you can join!

THAAD: Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile system

- US and South Korea plan to deploy in South Korea
- expands already vast US missile defense network encircling China and Russia
- rationale: threat of North Korea

.  These systems give the U.S. military the potential to neutralize an opponent’s ability to retaliate and appears to reflect a broader U.S. decision to change its military posture from one of deterrence to that of first strike.

The determination of the US government to use an expanding regional military presence to boost its regional political influence comes at high cost. It intensifies regional military tensions, fuels a new arms race, and increases the possibility of a new war on the Korean peninsula.  It also undermines the national sovereignty and democratic aspirations of people in South Korea.

South Koreans are fighting to block deployment of the THAAD system in their country.  They fear that its deployment will draw their country into an anti-Chinese alliance with the United States and Japan, embolden militaristic and anti-democratic political forces in their own country, and exacerbate tensions between North and South Korea.   They also worry about the negative health effects associated with the operation of the THAAD radar system. 

Also of concern is the cost of the THAAD system--estimated at $1.3 billion, plus an additional $22 million each year for operating and sustainment--which will be borne by South Korean and U.S. taxpayers.  The continuing development of new and more destructive weapons systems draws precious resources away from needed domestic social programs in both countries.

We urge the U.S. government to rescind its decision on THAAD deployment in South Korea.

  Standing Rock
  
  Thankstaking week
  
  shift accountability away from OC having to oversee KPT
  
  get an international advisory committee
  
  ellen's thoughts on keep
  
  - KEEP is super important
  - grounds you to importance of social justice work
  - see the effects of imperialism
  - national relationship-building
  - value of feeling connected to national network of Koreans in the US
  - motivated Ellen to be more actively building hobak
  - how would it look to train newer folks to train those skills/leadership
  - nodutdol is a glue that connects it
  - national advisory committee -->
  - dreams of ndd taking on this role of national network building
  - moim, keep --> national network building activities
  - hobak being a part of a formal national coalition would add capacity re: political education and relationships.
  - alignment and organizing moving into the KEEP trip
  
  landscape
  - end of 2015-2016, fizzled out for various reasons - personal reasons and burnout
  - study group came out of this. ellen started it with other members who weren't necessarily longstanding
  - outcomes: deeper political alignment and new relationships
  - question of what next
  - last session -- had informal conversations
  ppl were excited abt continuing to be in community
  
  now just figuring out what that is
  community is being built thru informal hangouts
  and the drumming crew e-yeon-see "connector" -- doubled
  there is a mix of politically active and just ppl interested in drumming
  
  b/c of thaad and pgh, lots of ppl have been looking for ways to plug in
  KPI is organizing anti thaad events
  so current moment seems ripe for ppl to come back
  
  do some work together
  how to bring hobak back
  
  what do you mean structured?
  
  eugene, hyejin
  
  25th anniversary of LA uprising
  
  hobak would be down with doing that
  
  send ellen KEEP process
  
  hobak has dreampt of a hobak
  
  drummers have talked about doing a trip
  
  keep ellen in the loop
  
  ellen will look and see if ppl are interested in being part of the advisory committee

>>>>
>>>> Hey. Tracy told me you two were friends and I appreciate you taking the time out to read our article and respond. I know you didn't know I was a Black and perhaps made some assumptions. I get that and appreciate the apology. I still think there are points made I would like to address.
>>>>
>>>> Anti-racist work is class warfare! I totally agree. We need to fight in the class struggle as women, women of color, working-class women of color all at once! They are not divided. Often the left you assumed I and Left Voice come from is terrible at class reductionism that is so quick to attack any kind of organizing of POC organization. Thats not my perspective and I have had to deal with that my entire political career! I have been fighting police brutality and capitalism since 2001. Was raised around Black Panthers etc. Actually tbh I was pulled over the other night and I nearly had a panic attack because the cops had their hands on their guns the entire time and I thought tonight could be my last. I am saying that so you know who I am and perhaps we can work together some day in fighting. :-)

>>>> So then my rhetorical question to you is when does an "ally" become an enabler of problematic politics because of the face of those politics? In BLMLA for example there has been bullying and transphobia done by some of the leaders of the group. People have silently walked away rather than fight because they did not want to disparage the movement. Was that the right thing to do?
>>>>
>>>> M4BL is working with one of the largest ad agencies in the world. They aren't open about their funds and as far as I know have not spoken to communities about whether to accept those monies or how to use them. There are many ways like starting a full time organizers around the country to fight police. Or open offices for the same purpose. Or free clinics or any number of community based organizing. Instead they put that money into an ad agency for Black capitalists. This ad agency is employed by the US Marine Corp who is bombing countries should we say nothing. Being silent about something rather problematic showing solidarity? Is it something a personal conversation would fix? I think we need to say something. I think we need to fight for what is right in the name of BLM and in the name of defending fighter from what seems like cooptation by the non profit industrial complex. That is what the article aims to do.
>>>>
>>>> Also, non Black POC I am guessing are wrestling with guilt of anti Blackness either they or their community have carried. But ultimately those people are responsible for their political decisions. And being silent about issues like the movement being institutionalized (at a moment when we need BLM tenacity and fight more than ever!) rests on the people head who know it is happening and say or do nothing. You are not the onky one to be resistant to airing out issues. However there have been other organizations that have called out issues of BLM namely the Black Agenda Report.
>>>>
>>>> Not sure if this answers anything perhaps it is the start of a conversation. I am tho committed to building an organization of working class women of color Marxists who engage each other and act politically in a principled way. I am not with BLM but I know the fight it has and that the people who are/were involved are in for the fight of our lives. We can't just go along to get along. Its not just a think piece to build a resume but to fight back in a way that we intend to win. In any case, I hope Left Voice can become that. That also means rejecting the academa-bros who attempt to speak on issues they don't understand and live. They are entitled to their opinion but we have to fight for the correct position and not let their arrogance with underlining bigotry stop us. Wanted to send this but may come off disjointed. I so appreciate you sharing your opinion. It has got me thinking about so many things. How clearer we could've been in some ways but also how perhaps Left Voice can engage the folks we want to build with more intentionally.

** my response
Hey Julia,

Thanks for the email! I appreciate you taking the time to respond to my email. I
just wanna say first off that a lot of my critiques in the first email were
responses to things that happened in a get-together Tracy hosted, in which a lot
of white socialists were very dismissive of "identity politics" and were trying
to figure out how to reach out to POCs (rather than say, organize white working
class folks) and just speaking in what I saw as dismissive terms of things like CopWatch
or other community organized forms of self protection (e.g., seeing copwatch as
volunteerism and not as organizing). It was uncomfortable to
be in a room with mostly white people and no black people and hearing them
be so dismissive of the BLM movement. So I read your article from that experience and
incorrectly conflated that meeting and your article as coming from the same
place. 

I totally agree that problematic practices among POC communities, including BLM,
should be aired and discussed, and I think the points you raised are definitely
important. I have a greater understanding of where yall were coming
from and how it's different from the informal gathering at Tracy's house (I have
not hung out with white socialists in a long time and I had forgotten what it
was like) and I support Left Voice's goal of building with working class WOC. I
also think your point about non-black POC is true and not something I have
really thought of before. I wonder about developing ways to air these critiques
both in conversation and in writing that don't seem to validate the class reductionism of many in the left and will
continue to think on that.

Again, I appreciate your response to my critiques, which were written in the
heat of the moment!
