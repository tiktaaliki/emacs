*** Digital image defined
- pixel :: a dot or square that comprises a digital image 
*** The image
**** Image reproduction & color mgmt (p. 1) 
- colors are viewed through either /additive/ or /subtractive/ light mixtures
- computer monitors = additive
- print color creation = subtractive
- RGB color model
- CMYK color model
- International Color Consortium :: puts forth ICC profile format to facilitate exchange of color data
- sRGB :: calibrated standard RGB color space 
**** Bit depth/dynamic range (2)
- dynamic range :: range of color & luminosity values, or ratio btwn brighest & darkest parts of an image

- resolution :: density of elements
- screen resolution :: # of pixels shown on a screen. ppi
- monitor resolution :: maximum possible resolution of a given monitor
- printer resolution :: # of dots per inch that can be printed
- capture resolution :: # of samples per inch that can be captured
- optical resolution :: describes values of actual samples taken
- interpolated resolution :: values that the capture device can add between actual samples captured

**** Compression (8)
- image compression :: shrinking digital file by storing redundant data or eliminating info human eye can't see
- 2 important factors of compression
   + compression ratios
   + generational integrity :: ability of compression scheme to prevent/mitigate loss of data
- lossless compression 🡆 ensures img data = retained
   + CCIT
   + LZW
- metadata shd always include compression scheme & level of compression
**** File formats (9)
- TIFF master files
- JPEG derivative / access files
- GIF thumbnail files 
- TIFF :: tagged image file format
   + tagged = internal structure
   + "If an institution chooses such an industry-promoted standard, it must select a particular version of the standard, create clear and consistent rules as to how the institution will implement the standard (i.e., create a data dictionary defining rules for the contents of each field), and make sure that all user applications support it. Without clear consensus on a particular standard implementation, both interoperability and information exchange may be at risk."
- JPEG :: joint photographers experts group
   + efficient compression w/acceptable image quality
   + lossy format
- PNG :: portable network graphics

since this was written in 2003, has PNG overtaken TIFF as predicted?

*** Conclusion
Sustaining digital resources requires an understanding and analysis of various features of digitisation, including technical, cultural, strategic and economic concerns. Digitisation will have its own cultural context and will have its own particular objectives and purpose. Therefore it is neither possible nor desirable to impose a fixed model for sustainability. What can be done however, is to apply a planned approach to digital sustainability that can increase the potential for the long term viability of digital resources. The key to planning for sustainability is to be able to articulate the impact, both expected and actual, of digitisation through an understanding of usage and users, competitiveness and value.

Developing a sustainability plan will help to maximise the potential for future support, be it from grant, philanthropic or institutional funding, and also help to assess the potential for revenue generation from more commercial sources. Research shows that in many cases in HE the host institution will be required to fulfil some role in sustaining digitisation outputs. It is therefore essential that projects or services can align themselves to overarching institutional goals and missions, develop institutional partnerships and engage relevant institutional support early on in the project life cycle, in order to maximise the potential for this to happen.

*** Literature review
**** The evolution of selection models
- role of liason? I don't exactly understand what a liason is
- this article refers to the other article we read about UNC transformation of its library system. 
- "bibliographer" functions taken on by Research and Instructional Services librarianship
**** Electronic resources and collection development (795)
- selection raises question -- format over content? 
- *"Selection of electronic resources involves special considerations of usability, technological compatibility with library systems, licensing restrictions, broad multidisciplinarity, and elevated pricing that are not usually an issue with print material."* (795)
**** Electronic resources management and the electronic resource librarian
- ERL positions - now normal in acad. libs.
- as electronic resources have become mainstream, the required competencies in job descriptions have shifted away from specific technical competencies to more general professional skills
*** Brief chronology of content dev. reorg. at UW libraries
**** UW Lib's centralized selection model
- allows for budgetary decision making and improved communication (794)
**** intradepartmental communication
- reorg. has facilitated informal discussions alongside formal (801)
**** the selection process
**** electronic resources mgmt in UW's collection development office
**** division of ERM labor
- team-based approach 
*** Advantages & challenges
*** Results
*** Conclusion
- centralizing selection process is most efficient way of dealing with increasing complexity of selection in academic libraries

*** 1. The multicultural library
**** 1.1 Introduction
**** 1.2 principles of multicultural library
- identifies the following groups as objects of attention:
  - minorities / asylum seekers and refugees / temporary residents / migrant workers / indigenous communities
- "Official publications of a country, such as information relating to government, law, education and business, are likely to exist only in the official language/s of that country. This situation is understandable, although it may be perceived as inequitable. Library staff can play a vital role in assisting multicultural groups to gain the information in the language, and at the level of understanding, they require." 
  - understandable? also....what does "perceived" as inequitable mean??
**** 1.3 defining multicultural library
- Indigenous peoples, immigrant communities, people with culturally-mixed backgrounds, transnational and diasporic individuals, asylum seekers, refugees, residents with temporary stay permits, migrant workers and national minorities.
**** 1.4 role and purpose of mcl
- libraries are about *learning, culture, and information*
- libraries should strive for multicultural acquisition and access
- embrace language learning
*** 2. The legal and financial framework
- ""Multicultural library services are in essence global. All libraries involved in activities in this field must participate in relevant local, national or international networks in policy development.""
**** 2.1 Multicultural lib and its governance
**** 2.2 administration of an MCL
- ""The maintenance and fostering of professional and international exchange relations with libraries, publishers and other relevant bodies in the original countries and communities of origin of multicultural groups.""
*** 3. Meeting needs of users

**** 4.4 multlingual collection dev and maint
**** 4.5 bibliographic control
- ""Transliteration of bibliographic information is often the only viable way of recording holdings in multiple languages, due to cost considerations, the shortage of linguistically qualified library staff, or the inability of library cataloguing systems to manage the characters of other languages. A transliterated record is often not intelligible to a user of a particular language and there is justification for limiting the depth of bibliographic information on the cataloguing record."" +what are the implications of this?+

**** Confidence game rules
1. The actions of confidence come first; the feelings come later
2. "Genuine confidence is not the *absence* of fear; it is a *transformed relationship* with fear."
3. Negative thoughts are normal. Don't fight them; defuse them.
4. Self-acceptance trumps self-esteem.
5. Hold your values lightly, but puruse them vigorously
6. True success is living by your values
7. Don't obsess on the outcome; get passionate about the process
8: Don't fight your fear; allow it, befriend it, channel it
9: Failure hurts -- but if we're willing to learn, it's a wonderful teacher
10. The key to peak performance is total engagement in the task.
**** TERMS AND DEFINITIONS
***** *task-focused attention* - being fully focused on the task at hand
***** *psychological flexibility* = mindfulness + values + committed action
***** *committed action* action taken that is guided by core values
***** *Private experiences*: THOUGHST AND FEELINGS
THOUGHTS: memories, thoughts, images
FEELINGS: emotions and sensations
******* EMOTIONS: such as fear and anxiety
******* MEMORIES: of past failures or mistakes
******* IMAGES: of things going badly
******* THOUGHTS: of failure, disaster, not being good enough
******* SENSATIONS: racing heart, dry mouth, butterflies
***** *fusion*: responding to thoughts, getting caught up in them. in a state of complete entanglement, having no distance, being completely fused with your thoughts
***** *workability*: "Is what you are doing working to help you create a richer, fuller, more meaningful life?" "If I allow this thought to guide my actions, will it help me create the life I want?"
***** *experiential avoidance*: trying hard to avoid or get rid of unwanted thoughts and feelings
***** *mindfulness* - paying attention with openness, curiosity, and flexibility
open to what happens even if dislike ro disapprove; curious about what's happening and seek to learn or discover something new in it; be flexible in scope of attention, can be wide in scope, can be narrow in scope
***** *the reality gap* - gap between the reality you want and the reality you have
***** *fragile self-esteem* - self-esteem that is based on performance
***** *autopilot mode* - being at the mercy of my emotions. not being in touch with values. emotions are running the show.
***** *avoidance mode* - trying to avoid the emotions entirely
**** The basic approach
***** 1. defusion (thoughts) : notice the thought, name the thought, neutralize the thought
***** 2. expansion (emotions) : make room for uncomfortable feelings (VS avoidance or autopilot mode)
***** 3. engagement (being present) : pay attention to whatever helps us to be the person we want to be and do what we want to do
**** The reality gap

So just back down? Open up and make room for the painful feelings, acknowledge the pain, and be kind. Then ask: What do I want to stand for in the face of this gap?

Ten years from now, when I look back on this period in my life, what would I like to say that I stood for; what values did I live by, in the face of that reality gap?
**** MOTIVATION VS. COMMITMENT
***** motivation = desire.
competing desires: the desire to avoid discomfort and the desire to act on our values.
***** shift emphasis from motivation to commitment.
action first, feelings later.
the way i feel about something is largely out of my control; but I can control the actions that I take
***** discipline & willpower: this person consistently commits to acting on their values and doing what is required to achieve their goals, even when they don't feel like it.

What desire is driving my behavior?
Am I seeking to avoid discomfort?
What about the desire to act in accordance with my values?

"If I let this desire dictate my actions, will it take my life in the direction I want to go?"

"Even though I don't feel motivated, am I willing to do what will make my life richer?"

If YES: Accept your thoughts and feelings, Choose a valued direction, and Take action mindfully (ACT)
**** FAILURE
Method 1: Failure is a fact of life. Give yourself permission to fail.
Method 2: Failure is honest feedback. It's a natural part of learning
how to REBOUND from failure:
STEP 1: Unhook
STEP 2: Make room
STEP 3: Be kind
STEP 4: Appreciate what worked
STEP 5: Find something useful
STEP 6: Take a stand by acting on your values
***** Persistence is the quality of continuing resolutely, despite problems or difficulties
***** Self-development is the quality of working to improve, strengthen, or advance your skills and abilities

"Do I value developing my writing skills further? Do i value persisting in the face of obstacles?"
If so, am I willing to do xxxxx?
**** SELF-AWARENESS
1. Mindfulness
	It is necessary to become aware of our habitual patterns of feeling, thinking, and acting.
2. Reflection
	Workability. What did I do that worked? What did I do that didn't work? What could I do differently next time around?
3. Feedback

To deal with "imposter syndrome" or self-doubt:
1. mindfully engage in the task at hand
2. later reflect on our direct observations
3. get feedback from trusted others
******* often having negative thoughts is not the problem, it's that we are disengaged from our experiences.
**** psychological smog:  the smog is not created by our thoughts. It is fusion /with/ our thoughts that create the smog.
***** STEP 1:  worrying ITSELF is OK. It is the FUSION that is problematic. It is holding onto the worry that is problematic.
***** STEP 2: identify the costs of worrying
the cost of worrying is not being psychologically present. we have experiences but they are not rewarding or fulfilling if you are fused to your worry. fear and anxiety do not interfere with performance, worrying does
***** STEP 3: Unhook from reasons to worry.
Instead ask yourself:
What can I do to deal effectively with this situation? What action could I take that might make a difference? Where could I get help or advice?

What's the worst thing that could happen? If it did happen, what could I do to cope? What actions could I take, or help/advice could I get?

If you CANNOT take action, make room for discomfort, defuse from worries, and engage in doing something meaningful
***** STEP 4: Distinguish worrying from taking care
eg: worrying about one's health vs taking care of one's health
***** STEP 5: Defuse from worrying itself.
When you notice worrying thoughts, defuse it. Say thanks! Or do the leaves exercise

where would genuine confidence make the most difference to me?
business?
social?
creative?
NDD?
Think about one of these fields and think about it in terms of the confidence cycle. To improve what I do in this field, what skills will I need to actively improve on?

If I want to get good at _____________, then I'll need to practice ___________.

Do this practice mindfully.

What essential skills will I start practicing mindfully?
How much will I practice them? When, where, and for how long?

writing and analysis. I want to practice writing and analysis.
**** practice
***** the idea of practice is uncomfortable. avoiding practice is to avoid discomfort. the goal shouldn't be to avoid discomfort. avoiding discomfort leads to making unworkable choices: doing what gives us the least short-term discomfort, rather than doing what will give us the most long-term fulfillment
***** the more i try to avoid discomfort, the more I will base my actions on how I *feel*, rather than on what is important.
**** values -- are a GUIDE. don't be hooked onto rigidly following them or berating yourself for failing to do so
**** process vs. outcome
commit to the process
engage in it fully
detach from the outcome
**** Reasons for lack of confidence
what is the cause behind my own lack of confidence? i think it's preoccupation with fear.
***** Excessive expectations: perfectionism
***** Harsh self-judgment: imposter syndrome
***** Preoccupation with fear: fear of failure, embarassment, rejection
***** Lack of experience
***** Lack of skills
**** Confidence Cycle
Practice -> apply (exit comfort zone) -> assess (non-judgmentally) -> modify
Genuine confidence: fully present and engaged + capable of effective action
**** Reason-giving: reasons why we can't do what really matters to us
What are my primary modes of reason-giving? I don't know if it's any of these...I tell myself that I can't do it. I think it's all of these, but part of it is that it no longer matters? Is that a sign of depression? I have values but I can't apply myself to them. I don't want to apply myself to them? Fear of what comes after? Fear of doing itself? Hmm.

What is a goal I can set that will take me out of my comfort zone? Some options:
[ ] write the first draft of that zoom in Korea article
[ ] create the book prototype
My commitment is to take the following action: On Tuesday I will write the first draft of the zoom in Korea article.
***** 1. We can only see the OBSTACLES and difficulties that are in the way of doing what matters
ask how you can address the obstacle, don't just let the obstacle be the end of it. how to make it helpful, is that what he's saying?
***** 2. SELF-JUDGMENTS: We tell ourselves that we're not up to the task and why we're not up to the task
respectfully appraise skills and give constructive advice on how to improve
***** 3. We COMPARE ourselves to others who can do it better, have it easier
allow these thoughts to guide you and create action from these thoughts
***** 4. We PREDICT failure, rejection
realistically appraise risks, think about worst case scenario, and see how to learn from experience.
**** FEAR
***** Fear is a normal reaction. It's part of the fight-or-flight response. It is something that happens naturally when you step out of your comfort zone. Fear is natural. In order to grow as a human, I will experience fear. It is a feeling.
***** Fear can be a source of energy
***** Fear itself can't hold you back -- it is your response to fear that will determine whether you move forward
**** Engagement
***** part of why it's hard to maintain focus is because i'm outside of my comfort zone. mindful breathing will help to improve focus.
**** raise self-acceptance, self-awareness, and self-motivation *INSTEAD OF* self-esteem
***** self-acceptance
it is not worthwhile to flog myself for my failures. let go of all-self judgments. In the event things don't go as planned, need to assess our *actions* in terms of workability. Are my actions working to give me a rich and fulfilling life?

Have to notice the self-judgments, both negative and positive. If my mind is telling me I'm worthless, identify it as a judgment. If my mind is telling me I am attractive, identify this too as a judgment. This can be done lightly.

don't get stuck on the TRUTH of such judgments -- it is whether these judgments are helpful. If i allow this thought/judgment to guide my actions, will that enrich  my life?

and don't get attached to either the negative or positive story. I'm a wonderful partner, I'm a terrible partner. Don't get attached to either story. It's jsut a story.

What matters are your ACTIONS, what you DO.


TRUE SUCCESS is *living by your values*
TRUE success would be living a life of community, growth, persistence, and justice.

*** A Quick Look at Your Values – page 1
Values are your heart’s deepest desires for how
 you want to behave as a human being. Values 
are not about what you want to 
get or achieve; they are about 
how you want to behave or act 
on an ongoing basis.  
There are literally hundreds of different values
, but below you’ll find a list of the most 
common ones. Probably, not all of them will be
 relevant to you. Keep in mind there are no 
such things as ‘right values’ or ‘wrong values’. It’s a bit like 
our taste in pizzas. If you prefer 
ham and pineapple but I prefer sala
mi and olives, that doesn’t mean
 that my taste in pizzas is 
right
 and yours is 
wrong
. It just means we have different 
tastes. And similarly, we may have 
different values. So read through 
the list below and write a letter

important, Q = Quite important, and N = Not 
so important; and make sure to score

ten

*** 1. Components of a problem statement (308)

**** Clark's 4 components of a problem statement
1. [ ] lead-in
2. [ ] declaration of originality
3. [ ] indication of central focus of study 🡆 purpose statement
4. [ ] significance or benefits of study/findings

**** Clark's 3 sentences for a problem stmt 
1. [ ] lead-in
2. [ ] statement about originality & study's contribution
3. [ ] justification


**** Questions provoked by a sample problem statement
1. Gatekeepers act as agents of acculturation when they disseminate information within their ethnolinguistic communities.
2. Yet, no study has probed the information-seeking behavior and the information dissemination practices of those gatekeepers in the complex, digital environment of today. 
3. Insight gained from such a study would be useful for public libraries seeking to serve the residents of ethnolinguistic communities.

- Do these 3 questions interlock? Together, do they indicate something unsolved?
- Who are gatekeeper? What are ethnolinguistic communities? 🡆 addressed in background section
- Does information-seeking behavior encompass information dissemination practices? (or, more accurately, what are the differences between information-seeking behavior and information dissemination practices?) Does sentence #2 sufficiently clarify and narrow intent of proposed study?

    + analysis starts w/theory or relevant findings as guidance for codes
3. summative
    + counting & comparisons, usually of keywords or content, followed by interpretation of underlying context


- major differences: between coding schemes, origin of codes, & threats to trustworthiness
- different research methodologies that analyze text data:
   + ethnography
   + grounded theory
   + phenomenology
   + historical research 

*** conventional content analysis
- usu. used w/study design aimed at describing a phenomenon
- good for when existing lit on the topic is limited
- data collection examples:
*** directed content analysis
- good when there s some stuff but more research is needed
- goal: validate or extend theoretical framework/theory
- main strength: can extend existing theory
- weaknesses: 
   + confirmation bias
   + overemphasis on theory
   + 

*** Summative content analysis
- begins w/identifing/quantifying certain words/content w/aim of understanding the conextual use. Not to understand meaning but explore usage

  :ABSTRACT:

The link between classification and knowledge is explored. Classification schemes have properties that enable the representation of entities and relationships in structures that reflect knowledge of the domain being classified. The strengths and limitations of four classificatory approaches  are described in terms of their ability to reflect, discover, and create new knowledge. These approaches are hierarchies, trees, paradigms, and faceted analysis. Examples are provided of the way in which knowledge and the classification process affect each other.

*** Introduction
- relationship between knowledge representation (i.e., classfications) and knowledge discovery and creation
**** Knowledge, theory, and classification
**** Classification as knowledge representation

**** Hierarchies
- best for 
  - _mature domains_ that are well known.
  - _well-defined_ entities
  - clear _class boundaries_ 
***** benefits
****** inclusiveness
****** species/differentia
****** inheritance
****** transitivity
****** systemic and predicable rules for association and distinction
****** mutual exclusivity
****** necessary and sufficient criteria
****** comprehensive and complete information
****** inheritane and economy of notation
****** inference
****** real definitions
****** high-level view and holistic perspective
***** limitations
****** multiple hierarchies
****** multiple and diverse criteria
****** lack of complete and comprehensive knowledge
****** differences of scale
****** lack of transitivity
****** rules for class inclusion are too strict
**** Trees
- subdivides like hierarchies but does not assume inheritance
- can represent many different types of relationships
- partitive - division of a class into subcomponents ad infinitum
- formal requirements
  - complete and comprehensive information
  - systematic and predictable rules for distinction
  - citation order
- useful for:
  - highlight/display relationship of interest
  - distance
  - relative frequency of entitites
- limitations
  - rigidity
  - one-way flow of info (can't rep multidirectional complex relatinships)
  - selective perspective - can't rep 
**** Paradigms
- /good discovery tools/. comparison. 
- entities described by interaction of 2 attributes at a time
- have a 2-way hierarchical relationship
  - axes represent 2 attributes of interest : shows entities classified along 2 dimensions at once
  - cells may be empty or may have more than one entity
- good for:
  - naming
  - distinction and lack of distinction
  - patterns of similarity and diff
  - empty cells
- limitations
  - requires knowledge of domain
  - limited perspective
  - limited explanatory power
**** Faceted analysis
- knowledge is not static. this is meant to build classifications that are flexible and can accomodate new phenomenoa
- good for establishing multidimensional description when theorizing or model building
***** steps:
- choose facets (criteria for description)
- develop facets
- analyze entities w/facets
- develop citation order
***** benefits
- does not require complete knowledge. can evolve
- hospitable
- flexibility
- expressiveness
- does not require strong theory
- can accomodate a variety of theoretical structures and models
- allows for mulitple perspectives
***** limitations
- difficulty of establishing appropriate facets. if not familiar with domain, may not choose best attributes. faceted method is hospitable to new entities but not to new fundamental facets
- lack of relationships among facets
- difficulty of visualization
**** classification & knowledge: how they interact
what is the relationship between classification and knowledge? 
***** changing explanatory frameworks
***** changes in perspective
***** changing entitites
***** classifications built when there is no conesnsus
***** classifications where there are no uniform or stable entitites
***** intersection of theory & economic interests
***** keys and other "thin" classifications

*** What is a MARC Record, and Why is it Important?
**** Part I: What Does MARC Mean?
- *cataloging record* types
  1. bibliographic records: represent holdings
  2. authority records: tools
- *Authority control* means establishing a recognized form for  an entity name and using that form whenever the name is needed as an access point in a bibliographic record.
  + author
  + subject headings
- *MARC Authority Record*: contains the standardized forms of names for people,  corporate bodies, meetings, titles, and subjects. In doing this, authority records provide authority control.
  1. _headings_: authoritative access point
  2. _cross references_: variant forms; see from tracings; see also from tracings
  3. _notes_: notes about the headings, citations for sources used
- Elements of a typical record are:
  - Standardized heading 
  - Variant name(s) or term(s) (see from tracings) 
  - Related name(s) or term(s) (see also from tracings)  
- The information in the authority record is used to create the following displays in the public catalog: - Variant name or term 
  - See Standardized heading 
  - Related name or term 
  - See also Standardized heading 
- The configuration of the authority record to include references as tracings is an efficient technique for recording the data needed for authority control. It successfully leads the user to sought material from a variety of names and terms.
**** Part II: Why is a MARC Record Necessary?
- MARC allows unlimited # of fields and field lengths
- allows for cooperative cataloging
**** Part III: MARC Terms and Their Definitions
- _fields_: 
- _tags_: 3-characters
- Cataloging Distribution Service by LoC.
- _indicators_: 2-characters after each tag. Undefined indicators marked with #
- _subfields_: preceded by delimiters
- _delimiter_: separates subfields
- _subfield codes_: preceded by delimiter
- _content designators_: tags | indicators | subfield codes
**** Part IV: What is a MARC Authority Record?
*****  1. The authority record content
****** Headings
- http://authorities.loc.gov/ => Library of Congress Name Authority File (LCNAF). for names
- LCSH. for topics or geographic names
- _types of headings_:
  1. name
  2. name/title combo
  3. /uniform title/: title not associated w/a particular author (like the bible)
  4. /subject/: a subject heading's tag is based on the first term/phrase in the heading. 
****** Tracings and references
- "_see references_" - 4XX - used to direct a user from an /unauthorized heading/ to an /authorized heading/
- "_see also references_" - 5XX - authorized to authorized heading
****** Notes 

***** 2. Structural components of authority records
1. _leader_: consists of info identified by relative charater positions. 24 characters in length and is the first field. 
2. _directory_: series of entries w/tag, length, and starting location of each variable field w/in a record. 12 characters in length. 
3. _variable fields_: identified by 3-char tag. Ends with a field terminator character
   - 00X: variable control fields
   - variable data fields: have 2 indicator positions and a 2-char subfield code preceding each data element. 
**** Part V: Are MARC Authority Records Shared?
- NACO (Name Authority Cooperative)
- SACO (Subject Authority Cooperative Program): established to provide a means for libraries to submit subject headings and classification numbers to the Library of Congress
- MARBI: Machine-Readable Bibliographic Information Committee
  - ALA committee w/3 reps from technical services (ALCTS), automation (LITA), and reference (RUSA)
- MARC Advisory Committee
  - composed of reps from orgs that have adopted MARC21 and participate in its development.

I.  INTRODUCTION

In this essay, the authors conclude: “Although a U.S.-DPRK alliance is certainly not likely  or even desirable, we have a chance to explore a US-DPRK security partnership if these overtures have substance; and if they do, we can then address the underlying concerns–a need for greater security–and to explore if there is an alternative relationship that would mitigate the consequences of a radical geopolitical realignment, improve everyone’s security in the region, and facilitate the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula…President Trump needs to seize the moment and find out.”

BEYOND THE SECOND TRUMP-KIM SUMMIT: TIME FOR REALISTIC NEXT STEPS

FEBRUARY 1 2019

Among the range of possible outcomes, the second Trump-Kim summit meeting is most likely to yield a suspension of much of North Korea’s fissile material and missile production and gradual declaration of some weapons facilities, as a useful starting point for complete denuclearization. In return the United States likely will take steps to meet the obligations it undertook at the historic June 12 Singapore summit “to establish new U.S.-DPRK relations” and “to build a lasting and stable and peace regime on the Korean Peninsula” by committing to a declaration to end the Korean War and exemptions from some sanctions.  When judged from where we were eighteen months ago, we are now in a safer place and moving in the right direction.  Both sides need to keep moving forward and hammer out a common understanding about how to fulfill the agreed Singapore goals.

The question now is what to do next?

The Trump administration rightly wants to go beyond a temporary suspension of the North’s weapons programs to dismantle its nuclear and missile facilities. But it is clear to us that accomplishing this in any meaningful fashion will require what Pyongyang perceives as the U.S. nuclear “threat” to it to recede.

The United States acknowledged as much in previous written agreements with the DPRK. In the 1994 Agreed Framework, Washington pledged “to provide written assurances against the threat or use of nuclear weapons by the United States.”   In the October 12, 2000 joint statement, the U.S. and the D.P.R.K. sides “stated that they are prepared to undertake a new direction in their relations. As a crucial first step, the two sides stated that neither government would have hostile intent toward the other and confirmed the commitment of both governments to make every effort in the future to build a new relationship free from past enmity.”[1] The September 19, 2005 Six-Party Joint Statement. Went further: “The United States affirmed that it has no nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula and has no intention to attack or invade the DPRK with nuclear or conventional weapons.” Renunciation of the U.S. nuclear threat against North Korea would not preclude a deterrent threat against China.[2]

The way for the U.S. nuclear threat to recede, this paper argues, is for Washington to move to end enmity and reconcile with Pyongyang. An end to enmity will require a peace process involving military confidence-building measures and culminating in a formal peace treaty to end the Korean War, progress by Washington and Seoul toward political and economic normalization with Pyongyang, and regional security arrangements.

This approach embraces what is a defining feature of President Trump’s North Korea diplomacy – that U.S. policy toward the DPRK has failed and therefore if we are to have any chance to get a different result, the problem of the North’s nuclear weapons and missiles must be reframed and old assumptions must be questioned.

Removing the U.S. “Nuclear Threat”

How does Pyongyang define what it calls “the U.S. nuclear threat?” A December 20, 2018 commentary in KCNA occasioned speculation that it was escalating its demand to eliminate U.S. weapons in Northeast Asia and beyond. The KCNA headline invites that speculation: “Korea’s Denuclearization Requires Removal of ‘All’ Nuclear Threats.” A close reading of the document does not support that interpretation, but it does suggest a need to probe what the North has in mind in subsequent negotiations.

The commentary was likely a belated reaction to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo’s comment on November 20, “We have made clear to the Republic of Korea that we do want to make sure that peace on the peninsula and the denuclearization of North Korea aren’t lagging behind the increase in the amount of inter-relationship between the two Koreas.”[3]

The commentary begins with a standard DPRK formulation, “It was the U.S. misguided understanding of the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula." In other words, the U.S. regards the big concept of the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula as the same as the partial concept of the ‘denuclearization of north Korea.’” It goes on to hint at an expansive view of the geographic scope of the nuclear threat: “When we refer to the Korean peninsula, they include both the area of the DPRK and the area of south Korea where aggression troops including the nuclear weapons of the U.S. are deployed. When we refer to the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, it, therefore, means removing all elements of nuclear threats from the areas of both the north and the south of Korea and also from surrounding areas from where the Korean peninsula is targeted.”[4]

In the past, Pyongyang has defined the threat as coming from any U.S. assets that ever carried or housed nuclear weapons, including bases on South Korea soil, nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and submarines that plied Korean waters, and bombers and fighter-bombers that crossed into Korea air space. The December 20 commentary in KCNA seems consistent with an authoritative July 6, 2016 DPRK Government spokesman’s statement, “We clearly state that the denuclearization we call for is the denuclearization of the entire Korean Peninsula. This includes the South’s nuclear abolition and the denuclearization of the areas around South Korea.” The statement went on to elaborate that message by listing five points. “First, all nuclear weapons of the United States, which it has neither confirmed nor denied after bringing them into South Korea, must be publicly disclosed. Second, all nuclear weapons and their bases in South Korea must be abolished, and their abolition verified before the world. Third, a guarantee must be made that the United States will never again introduce the means of nuclear strike to the Korean Peninsula and its surrounding areas, where it has frequently deployed them. Fourth, a firm commitment must be made to not threaten or blackmail us with nuclear weapons or through acts of war that mobilize nuclear weapons, and to not use nuclear weapons against our Republic under any circumstances. Fifth, the withdrawal of the U.S. forces, which hold the right to use nuclear weapons, from South Korea must be declared.”[5] Since the United States no longer based nuclear weapons in Korea, all but the third point could easily be satisfied.

If “surrounding areas” extends beyond Korean soil and territorial waters, however, it could encompass aircraft based in Guam and Japan or even farther afield, or planes flying in international airspace in East Asia, including around Korea. Yet such an expansive view would contradict another longstanding North Korean position: an end to enmity would mean it no longer feels threatened, whether by allied conventional or nuclear forces. It would also run counter to the North’s long expressed desire for an alliance or security partnership with the United States.

A critical question to be resolved is how far offshore from territorial boundaries the DPRK intends to exclude U.S. nuclear-capable delivery platforms; which platforms; what constitutes stationing versus transit, how transit would be treated; how the arrangement would be monitored and verified; and whether it would apply to all nuclear weapons states or only to the United States.  Such questions are standard in the design and implementation of regional nuclear weapons-free zones which we suggest below is an alternative to an alliance and an appropriate way to create a spatial delimitation of reciprocal commitments on all parties to cease us nuclear threats with respect to the Korean Peninsula.

A new opportunity to finally test an old hypothesis — a desire for a security partnership?

Conventional wisdom in Washington holds that Kim Jong Un seeks to dominate the Korean Peninsula and that, to accomplish this, he is singularly focused on the removal of U.S. troops.  Supporters of this view point to Pyongyang’s oft-repeated propaganda statements calling for their withdrawal.

Yet, as odd as it may seem to most Americans, DPRK diplomats have long spoken of an alliance with Washington in informal contacts with Americans.[6]  North Korean military representatives even hinted at that possibility in the early 1990s in military-to-military talks at Panmunjom. And Kim Yong Sun broached the subject with Undersecretary of State Arnold Kanter at the first high-level talks between the two nations in January 1992. An alliance like one the United States has with South Korea., moreover, would be backed by a U.S. troop presence on Korean soil, which North Korean leaders have told Presidents Kim Dae-jung and Moon Jae-in was permissible once the United States ended enmity. Such an alliance might also mean putting all of Korea under the U.S. nuclear umbrella.

But what about Kim Jong Un?  The good news is that for the first time in years we have the opportunity to talk with Kim Jong Un — and to do on a sustained basis — to discern intent.  And to the Trump’s credit, it appears this is what the U.S. is doing.  Indeed, there seems to be an Administration aware of Pyongyang’s interest in an alliance with Washington. In a June 7 interview with NHK, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo hinted at a willingness to do just that: “We want to achieve a fundamentally different strategic relationship between our two countries.”[7]

What better way, Kim Jong Un may be asking himself, for North Korea to be secure against its powerful near neighbor than to ally with a distant United States?  Understanding why Kim might be thinking along such lines is critical to identifying how the DPRK’s strategic interest may align with that of the United States, irrespective of President Trump’s idiosyncratic approach to negotiations or skeptical views towards alliances such as that between the United States and the ROK.

An alliance would certainly address the DPRK’s desire for security and a hedge against Chinese overreach and Japanese resurgence. It would unambiguously spell an end to what Pyongyang calls U.S. “hostile policy.” Holding out the prospect of an alliance would constitute the most compelling inducement for Pyongyang to undertake truly “complete denuclearization.”

Yet a reversal of alliances by North Korea, especially if U.S. troops remain as guarantor on the peninsula, would shift the tectonic plates of regional security. Indeed, it is our firm belief that an alliance between the US and North Korea is virtually impossible for a variety of reasons

To head off possible objections in South Korea, high level North Koreans have said privately (to some of the authors, among others) that the United States can have two allies in Korea at the same time.   Of course, conservatives in South Korea are not likely to regard that prospect with equanimity. Nor is Prime Minister Abe Shinzo, who until recently was resisting negotiations by anyone with North Korea. Opposition in Seoul and Tokyo may prove difficult for the Trump administration to overcome even if it should desire going down such a path with the DPRK, given lukewarm enthusiasm in Congress, which would have to approve any such treaty arrangement.  A strong critic of alliances, Trump himself might baulk at the prospect of allying with the DPRK.  Such a realignment is also likely to arouse suspicion, if not outright antagonism in China, which would not enhance security for anyone in the region. Xi Jinping’s repeated meetings with Kim Jong Un likely underscored China’s concerns about such a radical shift. Russia is also likely resent being left out of any solution.

Kim needs continuity with the past, specifically with the stances taken by his father and grandfather on fundamental and foundational orientations of his regime.  But he’s also his own man, determined to create a “Kim Jong Un” era, and he’s evidently savvy to the ways of the modern world.  Thus, although purely realist logic might suggest that it remains in the DPRK’s strategic interest to detach itself from close orbit around China, he may be ready and willing to settle for less: a diversification of the DPRK’s dependence on China and realignment to become a security partner with the United States rather than an ally.  Such a stance might stress the DPRK’s alliance with China, but would not rupture it; and would enable the United States to become a pivot deterrent force in Korea that would ensure that the ROK, with its much larger economy and population, and its far superior military force, would not overwhelm the DPRK.

Another alternative — a comprehensive security approach

Given the downside risks of a U.S-DPRK alliance, is there a better way to accommodate the concerns of other regional players and enhance the security of all?

One possibility is a comprehensive security approach that would necessarily involve all the regional players in parallel negotiations at an appropriate time and assure that their security concerns are addressed.

What would a comprehensive settlement look like? As set out in an earlier Nautilus Institute special report,[8] it has six inter-locking essential elements:

    Begin a three- or four-party peace process to replace the Korean Armistice with a peace declaration, committing to negotiate a peace treaty or to establish what the September 2005 Joint Statement refers to as a “peace regime.”
    Declare non-hostility and move to normalize political and economic relations.
    Gradually relax sanctions over time.
    Provide humanitarian assistance to the DPRK and economic and energy aid, especially aid which benefits the whole region by completing many types of energy, telecom, logistics, transport, mobility, trading, financial networks that link the land-bridge from Eurasia to the ROK and Japan via North Korea.
    Set up a Six Party Northeast Asia Security Council.
    Establish a nuclear weapons free-zone (NWFZ) in which to re-establish DPRK’s non-nuclear commitment in a legally binding manner that provides a framework to  dismantle its nuclear facilities and weapons and to manage the nuclear threat in the region in a manner that treats all parties, including North Korea, on an equal basis.

The first five elements have long embodied the end of enmity for the DPRK, all of which were agreed in the September 2005 Six-Party Joint Statement but never carried out. If, as suspected, the lack of progress in implementing these steps jeopardized progress toward denuclearization in the past, it is difficult to imagine that denuclearization will make much headway now without parallel efforts to satisfy its objectives.

The sixth element, a nuclear weapons-free zone (NWFZ), could provide a credible alternative a U.S.-DPRK alliance. Although this vehicle may be surprising to some and certainly unconventional to others, it is in fact a now standard institutional framework in many regions of the world.  The other five parties might establish a legally binding NWFZ to create a path for the DPRK’s eventual acceptance and entry in lockstep with specific actions to eliminate its nuclear weapons. North Koreans starting with Kim Il Sung in 1980 have expressed interest from time to time in such an arrangement.[9]

Advantages of a NWFZ as a platform for addressing U.S.-DPRK enmity

A NWFZ agreement has important advantages over a bilateral alliance and denuclearization deal. First, while both are legally binding, to the extent that a NWFZ brings in other parties it would strengthen the legal and political bonds and thereby help enhance the DPRK’s perception of the durability of any proposed deal. Second, it may also be more enduring because it affects how the nuclear weapons states use nuclear threats against all the non-nuclear weapons states party to the treaty, and thereby against each other. Third, it could entail security commitments beyond those in the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Finally, a NWFZ can serve as an effective substitute for a security alliance by providing the DPRK, once it is certified as nuclear weapons-free, with a guarantee that the United States will not make it the subject of nuclear threat or attack and will defend it against attacks by another nuclear weapons state or ally of such a state.

Although the two Koreas have been reluctant to sign treaties with one another because that might affect their competing claims to sovereignty over the entire peninsula, a NWFZ treaty is a standard U.N. multilateral convention that both Koreas have had no problem signing in the past. Moreover, the other four parties may be skeptical as to the durability of a Korea-only denuclearization agreement and prefer the multilateral rather than unilateral guarantees provided by the Nuclear Weapons States to under the Non-Proliferation Treaty. A U.N. NWFZ with the two Koreas as founding non-nuclear weapons states would be made open to signature at the outset or later by other non-nuclear weapons states in the region such as Japan or Mongolia.

In this approach, the U.S.-DPRK relationship would change from enemies to security partners, that is, the DPRK would be neither an enemy nor an ally, but something in-between. A security partner is a state that is not a full-fledged ally and may in some instances still have serious security conflicts with the United States or its allies, as is the case with U.S. ties to Saudi Arabia or Pakistan. And such a partnership might yield more leverage than we have had in the past for dealing with other issues, such as human rights.

Under such conditions, a security partnership involving U.S. forces and the Korean People’s Army of the DPRK would not end of the U.S.-ROK Combined Forces Command, with wartime U.S. operational control of ROK forces.  Deterrence would remain in play until military tensions ease to point where war is no longer a plausible option for either Korea, which may take decades.  In short, a security partnership with the KPA is compatible with U.S. extended deterrence to its allies.

Carpe Diem

In past overtures, Americans have ignored or rebuffed what many dismissed as absurd or unserious North Korean suggestions that it might become an American ally.  Although a U.S.-DPRK alliance is certainly not likely  or even desirable, we have a chance to explore a US-DPRK security partnership if these overtures have substance; and if they do, we can then address  the underlying concerns–a need for greater security–and to explore if there is an alternative relationship that would mitigate the consequences of a radical geopolitical realignment, improve everyone’s security in the region, and facilitate the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.

For too long, American and allied academics and policy makers alike have been making assumptions about North Korea’s strategic intent and arguing among themselves as to what is real and not real.  We now have the chance to talk on a sustained basis to Kim Jong Un, the only person who really matters in North Korea.  We have the chance to probe and test what he wants as we have never before.  President Trump needs to seize the moment and find out.

  This chapter was more interesting than the others. The idea of information science is appealing to me, particularly the knowledge-management aspects. I enjoy the data side of librarianship and information -- storage and retrieval. 
  
  People's search habits--this has been well covered in other classes. 
  
  Distinguishing btwn data, info, and knowledge was interesting. 
  
  How will this tie into the other readings?

- _information science_: Science that investigates properties and behavior of info, forces governing flow of info, and means of processing it for optium accessibility and usability. 
  + format agnostic
  + covers information cycle from creation to use
  + recogniz. interdisciplinary nature of field
- IS - deinstitutionalized library science
- _3 core concerns_: (Summers et al)
  + storage
  + communication
  + use
- _3 big questions_: (Bates)
  + /physical/ - features & laws of recorded information universe?
  + /social/ - how to ppl relate to, seek, and use info?
  + /design/ - most rapid & effective access possible?
**** III. Defining the nature of information
***** A. Distinguishing btwn data, info, and knowledge
****** 1. Data
- building blocks of info and knowledge
****** 2. Information
- data that has been assigned meaning
****** 3. Knowledge (and wisdom)
- cohesive body of information (so a whole lot of data that's been assembled into pieces of information by having been assigned meaning...then when you get enough of these pieces of info, it becomes knowledge)
- p. 363
- how does sthg bcm acptd as knwldg?
- Web = redef. what ppl see as authoritative
***** B. The value of information and value-added processes
- to understand info is to appreciate its value
- economics of information (364)
- the value added functions of a librarian
  + access processes
  + accuracy
  + browsing
  + currency
  + flexibility
  + formatting
  + interfacing
  + ordering
  + physical access
**** IV. Information storage and retrieval
- purpose of info storage and retrieval is to capture wanted and filter out unwanted items
- require both _relevance_ to the /user/ and to the /topic/
***** A. Precision, recall, and relevance

***** B. Searching tools
***** C. Database and file structure
- _database_: collection of data stored to facilitate addition, updates, deleting, and access. 
- flat files
- relational
- spreadsheets
- object-relational
***** D. Human-computer interaction
**** V. Bibliometrics & citation analysis
***** A. Bibliometrics
***** B. Citation analysis
**** VI. Impact of info science in libraries
***** A. Understanding information behavior: information needs and information seeking
****** 1. information needs
- _information want_: desire for info to satisfy an uncertainty
- _information need_: condition in which info is required to solve a problem
- _information seeking_ vs _information gathering
****** 2. information seeking
******* a. there is a diff btwn info seeking & info gathering
******* b. info seeking proceeds in stages
******* c. ppl usu. search for info in some context
******* d. ppl seek info from ppl first
******* e. principle of least effort
******* f. internet searching behavior
******* g
******* h
******* i. search abilities vary among individuals
**** VII. Emerging info sci areas affecting lis professionals
***** A. Informatics
***** B. Big data
***** C. User experience design
***** D. Knowledge mgmt
**** VIII. Summary

*** Ch 9. Intellectual freedom
- John Stewart Mill 🡒 need intellectual freedom against tyranny of majority, tyranny of the gov't
- p. 488: Libraries haven't always defended against censorship. e.g., 19th & 1st half of 20th c.: libs saw selves as "protector", there was a paternalistic approach. Hitler was catalyst.
  + 1939 ALA library bill of rights
  + 1940 established Intellectual Freedom committee
- despite this, ALA gave little support to individuals (lipservice, just like their diversity)
- I wonder at the overlap between pro-mccarthyists & librarians.
- p. 491 - ALA's proudest moments? LOL (cf. Asato, p. 289 about ALA's "help")
- factors that restrict access (p. 482)
  + personal values
  + community values
  + "protect" children
  + library survival
- factors that increase access
  + need to educate
  + professional standards
  + obligation to protect rights of citizens
- p. 496 "standard self-censorship rationales"
  + hard to find materials
  + lack of potential circulation
  + lack of budget
  + no LGBTQ ppl in community
- p. 497 relationship btwn media & violence ...
  + these studies are correlational and only look at short-term effects.
  + no real evidence about negative influence of books

*** Ch 10: Values and ethics of LIS
**** I.  Intro
**** II. The values of LIS
***** A. 7 values
****** 1. Service
- p. 535 Librarianship emerged as one of the service-oriented professions of the nineteenth century in part as a reaction to the profit-centered, entrepreneurial excesses of the industrial revolution
- p. 535 his mention of "sacrificial wage" seems disingenuous given pay inequity btwn men and women
- we get Ranganathan's 5 laws:
******* a. books are for use (access)
******* b. every reader his/her book
******* c. every book the reader
******* d. save the time of the reader
******* e. the lib must be a growing organism
******* Gorman's modifications
- libraries serve humanity / respect all forms of communication of knowledge / use tech intelligently / protect free access / honor the past and create the future
****** 2. Importance of reading and the book
****** 3. Respect search for truth
****** 4. Tolerance
****** 5. A public good
****** 6. Justice - information equity - 
****** 7. Aesthetics
***** B. core values and ALA
- common to most assertions of LIS values was *service, privacy, equity of access*
- p. 545: ""The underlying ethical question was whether reference librarians can be totally neutral in the performance of their duties, or whether social consequences of the information should be considered."" --> _wha? these two don't even seem related. first there is the question of whether a librarian or anyone can even be neutral. what does it mean to be neutral in the performance of their duties? and also...if the library is meant to be a public good, then why wouldn't the social consequences be considered? on the other hand, it seems that the actual question is: what is the line being drawn? where that drawing of the line actually is is an ideological question._ 
**** III. Ethics of LIS
- 3 main periods of ethics
  - pre-1930 - what types of material to include in collections
  - 1930-1950 - workplace ethics
  - 1960+ - improving public good, promoting social justice, and political progressiveness
  - *7 stakeholders in information dissemination process*: authors / publishers / database producers / database vendors or networks / information professionals / organization and managers / end user consumer
  - p. 550 - "evidence that exposure to violent materials might lead to levels of increased aggressive behavior" -> _the article isn't even cited correctly and the conclusio ns are barely relevant enough for rubin to use this as "evidence"_
***** A. Factors in ethical deliberations
****** 1. social utility
****** 2. survival
****** 3. social responsibility
****** 4. respect for the individual
***** B. Categories of ethical concern
****** 1. Free access to info and effects of info
****** 2. Selection and acquisition decisions
****** 3. privacy
****** 4. copyright
- copyright creep
****** 5. organization of info
- obviously this is ethical too. 
****** 6. information policy
****** 7. information quality
****** 8. ethical issues in the workplace
****** 9. impact of tech on ethical behavior
******* a. computers promote sense of anonymity
******* b. easy to steal remotely
******* c. large potential reach
******* d. copying is easy
******* e. everyone does it
***** C. Professional codes of ethics
****** 1. ALA code of ethics
******* a. access issues
******* b. rights of authors and creators
******* c. employment issues
******* d. add'tl interpretive statements
****** 2. American Society for Information Science & Technology (ASIS&T) guidelines for professional conduct

*** Part III: Research Designs and Sampling
**** 7. Case studies (51)
***** What is a case study?
- 11 key characteristics:
   1. natural setting
   2. multiple methods of data collection
   3. a few entities are examined
   4. complexity of the entity is examined
   5. useful for knowledge-development or exploration stages
   6. no experimental aspects
   7. no construction of dependent & indep variables
   8. findings v. reliant on investigator
   9. Δ can occur as new hypotheses develop
   10. useful for "why" and "how"
   11. present tense/contemporary events
***** When should they be used?
- does the phenomenon have to be studied in a natural setting?
- is it focused on contemporary events?
- does the research question aim to answer "why" or "how" questions?
- are the factors & relationships involved things that can be directly observed?

***** Designing a case study
****** Identifying unit of analysis
****** selecting a case
- theoretical sampling vs statistical sampling
- 5 reasons to select a case
   1. representative
   2. it is critical
   3. it is unique
   4. it is revelatory
   5. it is a longitudinal case
- multiple case studies aka comparative case studies
   + literal replication vs theoretical replication
****** collecting data
- triangulation :: combining results from different data collection methods
   1. data triangulation
   2. investigator triangulation
   3. methodological triangulation
   4. theory triangulation
- p. 56: criteria for assessing the quality of a given case study
   + resonance criteria :: degree to which report fits w/selected theoretical frameowrk
   + rhetorical criteria :: form, structure, & presentation of report
   + empowerment criteria :: ability to evoke & facilitate action by the reader (educativeness, fairness, & actionability)
   + applicability criteria :: feasibility of making inferences from case study results 
***** strengths & weaknesses

***** Probability sampling: Concepts & definitions
- population :: "collection of elements about which we wish to make an inference"
- element :: "object on which a measurement is taken"
- sampling frame :: all eligible elements
- probability sample :: two main elements
   1. every element of population has nonzero probability of being selected into the sample
   2. elements can be randomly selected

****** Procedures for selecting a probability sample
- define population
- need to make note of target/desired pop & actual sample
- unit of analysis -- individ or grps?
- identify/construct sampling frame -- list needs to be clear
- select elements from sampling frame
****** Simple random sampling
single sampling frame
random number tables
****** Systematic sampling

****** Stratified sampling

****** Cluster sampling

***** Nonprobability sampling: concepts & defs

****** Quota sampling
- which characteristics of the population are of interest?
- set quota for each characteristic
****** Purposive sampling

****** Snowball sampling

****** Convenience sampling

****** Crowdsourcing

***** Sample size
- hypothesis testing: need to consider 4 aspects re: sample size
   + what is the effect size you want to detect? the smaller effect size, the larger the sample
   + 

***** Effects of nonresponse on a sample
**** 15. Sampling for intensive studies
**** 16. Studying special populations
*** Part IV: Methods for data collection
**** 17. Historical research (p. 155, Morgan & Wildemuth)

***** Introduction
***** Methods
****** Finding a subject
****** Gathering sources
- have to exhaust all modes of inquiry
- need to also search other fields  
- Step 1: Compile and master relevant secondary literature (informal)
- Step 2: formal search via catalogs & databases
****** Interpreting the evidence
- 4 fallacies:
   + generalization (applying findings to wider scope than warranted)
   + reduction (forget that there are multiple causes & factors of any 1 given event)
   + tautology
   + misplaced literalism (being overly credulous of primary sources) 
***** Examples
****** Example 1: The contributions of Hannah Packard James to Public Libraries
****** Example 2: Origin & Realization of Federal Register
***** Conclusion
historical research is maybe less linear than other research. 
**** 18. Existing documents & artifacts as data (165)

***** Introduction
- using documents/artifacts as data
   + could be more accurate than self reports
   + non-intrusive/non-reactive/dead data
- 2 steps
   + what is the phenomenon of interest?
   + what is relationship between phenomenon and data? 
***** Documents as data
***** Artifacts as data
***** Analyzing data obtained from documents and artifacts
- analyzed through triangulation 
***** Examples
- Example 1: Public Documents as Data
   + identification of terms, then coded.
- Example 2: Use of org docs by members
   + documents incorporated w/participant observation & interviews, and then 22 additional interviews

**** 22. Direct observation
**** 23. Participant observation
**** 24. Research diaries
**** 25. Unstructured interviews (p. 239)

- used for theory development rather than hypotheses testing
- useful for information seeking/behavior research
***** The role of the interviewer
- 3 main question types
   + descriptive questions
   + structural questions (to discover how interviewees organize their knowledge)
   + contrast questions  
***** conducting an unstructured interview
- 3 main difficulties
   + requires significant time investment
   + difficult to direct conversation
   + data analysis
***** challenges
***** examples
- grounded theory approach 🡆 used to build models from qualitative data
- open coding
- axial coding
- 

**** 26. Semistructured interviews
***** Developing the interview guide
- outline major topics related to study's objectives, and list questions associated w/each topic
- 4 types of questions
   1. essential questions
   2. extra questions
   3. throw-away questions
   4. probing questions
- problematic questions
   1. affectively worded questions
   2. double-barreled questions
   3. complex questions
- interview techniques: timeline interviews & critical incident technique
   + timeline interviews - sense making theory
***** Conducting the interview
***** Data capture and reanalyses
***** Examples
**** 27. Focus groups
- Issues to consider in conducting focus group research
   + set study objectives
   + select moderator
   + recruiting participants
      - control characteristics
      - break characteristics
      - 8-12 per group w/4-6 groups per study is common
      - overrecruit by 20-25%
- online focus groups
- good choice if participant interaction will provide interesting findings. arguing opinions in social settings. 
**** 28. Survey research
- consult other studies that may have done similar research. 
- survey construction guidelines
   + ask only what can be answered
   + ask only what is necessary to answer the research question
   + questions should be in complete sentences
   + use neutral language
   + questions should be specific enough to elicit interesting answers but not too specific that they can't be answered
   + each question should ask one question
   + do not make the questions required
- survey types: open ended & closed ended
- survey organization
   + introduction - substantive questions - classification questions

**** 29. Measuring cognitive and affective variables
- chronbach's alpha has to be at least 0.70 to be sufficiently reliable for use in research studies
- Cognitive Styles Analysis inventory
**** 30. Developing new measures
- measures of information literacy self efficacy, online privacy concern protections on the internet, user engagement during online interactions.
- examples of measures: satisfaction w/something, attitudes toward it, frustration, motivations and interests, competency, etc.
***** Approaches to measurement
- Likert (& other) scales
   + response style 
- semantic differential scales
   + evaluation (good-bad)
   + potency (strong-weak)
   + activity (active-passive)
- other approaches
***** The process of developing a measurement instrument
****** defining the construct
- clearly define what it is I want to measure, and what the goals of that measurement are.
- examples of constructs: achievement, attitudes, emotions
- define the construct (scope & subcomponents) -- draw on theoretical literature when developing definition
- 
****** developing item pool
****** creating inventory from items
****** pilot testing inventory
*** Part V: Methods for data analysis
**** 31. Content analysis
- content analysis :: "systematic, objective, quantitative analysis of message characteristics"
- Shannon & Weaver's theory of information --> information that travels from source to destination. cf. affect theory. content analysis can be expanded to that of affect.
- create hypothesis about body of messages.
   + my hypothesis: media content will promote anti-north korean sentiment ? seems like a boring hypothesis...
- quantitative vs qualitative content analysis
- sampling unit :: what you will sample from the overall population of the text. so, for example, each article could be a unit in the sampling frame
- recording unit :: elements of content that are coded. can be physical/conceptual/temporal. could be a sentence or a paragraph or a whole article
- indicators :: these are what you will code for and count.
***** coding
- categories must be:
   1. exhaustive
   2. non-overlapping
- intercoder agreement guidelines
   + need a measure of agreement
   + minimum acceptable level of reliability
   + assess reliability info 
**** 32. Qualitative analysis of content
**** 33. Discourse analysis
1. construct research question
2. select sample discourse
3. collect documents
4. code data
    1. level of detail depends on needs of research questions
    2. identify themes w/in categories
5. textual analysis
    1. search for patterns, then similarities
    2. variations and contradictions
    3. ask how differences are accounted for and identify and annotate textual proof
    4. formulate hypotheses about form & function of text based on analysis
    5. look for where evidence does and does not fit.
6. validate findings 
**** 34. Social network analysis
**** 35. Descriptive statistics
**** 36. Frequencies, cross-tabulation, and the chi-sqaure statistic
**** 37. analyzing sequences of events
**** 38. Correlation
**** 39. Comparing means: /t/ tests and analysis of variance

The most pernicious aspect of procrastination is that it can become a habit. We don’t just put off our lives today; we put them off till our deathbed.
 
Never forget: This very moment, we can change our lives. There never was a moment, and never will be, when we are without the power to alter our destiny. This second, we can turn the tables on Resistance.
 
This second, we can sit down and do our work.

The danger is greatest when the finish line is in sight. At this point, Resistance knows we’re about to beat it. It hits the panic button. It marshals one last assault and slams us with everything it’s got.

*** Assessment
- this is a column (?)
- how do ppl identify what people need to learn to be fully engaged citizens?
- /questions to ask/: What is the source of the information? What is its point of view and purpose? Is it designed to educate/inform, sell, or persuade? How accurate, up to date, and complete is the information? How does it compare to other sources on the same or similar topics?
- What does “library instruction” mean to you and your community, however you label it? What do members of your community already know about information researching? What do you expect the learners in your community to know and be able to do on their own related to information researching, and at which age and educational levels?

*** Introduction
- /information behavior/ 
  - how ppl interact w/information; how they seek it out and then utilize it.
  - LIS subdiscipline studying human relationship to info
*** Information
- /information/ encompasses any situation where a person's knowledge store is changed
- /goal/ is to study this in order to facilitate /information transfer/
*** history of information behavior research
- /ASK/ - anomalous state of knowledge
*** Info searching vs seeking
- 2 aspects:
  - how ppl interact w/info, how and where they seek it, and how they use it
  - act of searching itself
*** role of technology
- major innovations:
  - computer enabled online catalog.
    - 1980s -- "first widely available end-user information search systems, and much was learned about how untrained people did and did not succeed in this form of online searching"
  - information retrieval: facilitated by indexing & retrieval
  - online database searching
  - WWW
  - digital libraries
- HCI: human computer interaction
*** range of topics of information behavior research
- principle of least effort. people valued ease of use and access more than quality of information obtained
*** conclusions
- We understand information behavior better within social contexts and as integrated with cultural practices and values.

- "Discarding the biological myth of race need not be a step toward the regressive popular ideology known as colorblindness. The colorblind ideal champions a baffling notion that ignoring a history of racial violence and its many legacies will somehow make racism disappear. On the contrary, exorcising racecraft requires that we plunge deeper into our history in order to understand exactly how, when, and why race has been marshaled for various political, economic, and social ends. Yes, realizing that these identities are not biological or divine is disorienting; it is also an opportunity to consider how and why race remains so powerful today, both as a site of discrimination and a source of resistance. "

- "Considering what remains of racial identity once the biological myth is discarded, students begin to consider Blackness as an identity that is chosen by society and individuals in the past and present, for disparate ends. Moving from the framework of race as inevitable towards the realization of race as historically created allows students to perceive how race is still being made and remade in their own lives."
- "Rejecting racecraft requires that we live in a state of non-alignment with our national political and social order; there are costs to seeing and living outside the racetinted lenses of our national collective vision. "

      - bringing history closer to home. also moving away from "hero narratives"
      - home becoming historical
   + (3) explicitly engaging with the emotional and embodied elements of archival research.
      - 447: records were valuable for how they affected the participants -- quality of original artifact not so much, but rather process of interpretation
- 448: "Our project found that the power of these resources lies not simply in the information they can provide but in the emotional response they can generate. This coincides with recent analyses of activism that emphasize the imaginative and emotional side of the activist endeavor. Archivists need to be aware of the temporal, spatial and affective power of archives, and in evaluating the impact of archives, we need to look not simply at changes in skills, knowledge and attitude but at the experiences of users defined in affective terms, not simply in terms of ‘‘success/failure’’ at finding information and using it according to pedagogical models."

*** Chapter 1: Information resource management
**** Introduction
***** What is the primary focus of this book?
- mechanisms the library sector has extablished for identifying the materials for which its sector is responsible
- libraries: access is 2-pronged
  - topical labeling -> content info
  - content labeling -> identification info
***** Which sectors comprise the information world?
- Internet, libraries, & online info service providers
**** Timelines in Information Access
***** Foundations, both environments
- started in 1945.
- coordinate indexing: uniterms
***** 1957-1970, the Internet Environment
- Oct 1957 Sputnik launch.
- Oct 1958 NASA and ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency)
- August 1969: ARPANET
***** 1957-1970, the library and online database industry environment
- MARC (machine readable cataloging) rise in batch processing of data
- 1960s saw growth of int'l cooperation. Int'l Conference on Cataloguing Principles.
- developments in indexing theory and practice
***** 1971-1980, the internet environment
- 1971 1st arpanet email & 1st published instance of "internet"
***** 1971-1980, the library and online database industry environment
- major development: shared library cataloging systems
- transformation of catalogs from catalog-card drawers to computer databases (OPAC)
***** 1981-1990 the internet environment
***** 1981-1990 the library and online database industry environment
- IFLA cmte started work on developing a new base for determining the nec. factors for achieving optimum bibliographic retrieval
***** 1991-2000 the internet environment
***** 1991-2000  the library and online database industry environment
***** 2000 on,  the internet environment
***** 2000 on,  the library and online database industry environment
***** future prospects
**** Library and internet access provisions
***** what are the 2 concepts behind bibliographic control?
- recall and precision.
- what is recall?
  - delivers almost everything in the database that matches a query
- what is precision?
  - if the search returns nothing else
**** Bibliographic control
- codification and classification = necessary for increased cooperation
**** Functions of bibliographic control
- descriptive cataloging: 
  - 1. describe significant features of book and characterize its contents, scope, and bibliographical relations
  - 2. present the data in a consistent manner and user friendly
- Paris Principles - defined the functions of a catalogue
- guidelines for coding get progressively more complex
***** objects 
- objects are the elemements of bibliographic control that allow one to find an item by title/author/subject and see its edition and character (literary or topical)
***** means
- populating the database with all the necessary objects and with sufficient links to make stuff findable
**** Bibliographic control through surrogates
- 2 methods: storing full text vs creating and storing brief representations
- document surrogates = bibliographic records
- LCSH - list of subject headings (library of congress subject headings)
- classification numbers (obtained from DDC and LCC)
  - ddc: dewey decimal classfiication; LCC = library of congress classification
  - classification # -> book #/item # -> control # (eg isbn)
- one term per entity principle
- authority lists, authority work
- MARC - standard encoding system for library materials
- metadata schema: "structured data about data" (for items that don't fit well w/standard cataloging systems)
**** Surrogate production
***** description

*** Chapter 5: RDA and its foundations
- TERMS:
  - RDA: Resource description and access
**** Introduction
- 3 major benefits to RDA:
  - helps catalog users more easily find info 
    - based on conceptual models of FRBR and FRAD
    - each section has guidelines for recording attributes and relationships as they relate to:
      - finding
      - identifying
      - selecting
      - obtaining
  - allows for cataloging of both traditional books and digital materials
  - is a better fit w/emerging database technologies

***** Functional requirements for bibliographic records (FRBR)
- established in 1998 by IFLA (International Federation of Library Associations)
- entity-relationships (ER) model
- belongs to FR family models
- major user tasks in FRBR: find, identify, select, acquire
- 3 entity groups
  + .1.. /work, expression, manifestation, and item/
    * work: a distinct creation
    * expression: the form in which the creation is made. e.g., E1: Text-English; E2: Text-German; E3: Audiobook-English
    * manifestation: physical embodiment of an expression
    * item: single exemplar of a manifestation
  + 2. /person, corporate body, family/
  + 3. /concept, object, event, place/
- currently bibliographic descript. often include: /work, expression/, /manifestation/ information
- entities are inherent or external
***** Functional requirements for authority data (FRAD)
- premise: bibliographic entities are known by names/identifiers that should be used as the basis for +controlled access points+
- expand on FRBR to define requirements for authority records
- major user tasks in FRAD: find, identify, contextualize, justify
  + justify: document authority data creator's reason for choosing the controlled access point
+If there's a difference between manifestation titles, is it the job of the authority data person to decide on the work title?+
***** Functional requirements for subject authority data (FRSAD)
- published 2011
- premise: works have a subject or are about a subject matter. used to indicate "aboutness"
- entities: /thema/, /nomen/
  + types of /themas/ can include objects, events, places, concepts (the 3rd entity group of FRBR)
- user tasks: find, identify, select, explore
- LRM: consolidation of 3 FR family conceptual models into one Library Reference Model
***** International standard bibliographic description (ISBD)
- 1969. standardize content & format of bibliographic descriptions to increase sharing & exchange of bibliographic data
- comprised of *elements*, and punctuation.
- 2011 the consolidated version was published
**** RDA basics
- IFLA /statement of international cataloguing principles/
  - differentiation / sufficiency / relationships / representation / accuracy / attribution / common usage or practice / uniformity
- p. 163: list of all the RDA sections
**** RDA elements and access points
- *access points*: names, codes, terms used to *represent* an entitiy
- *elements*: data used to *describe* an entity
**** RDA and MARC
- MARC 21 is used to *encode* bibliographic records
- RDA is used to *describe* bibliographic records
*** Chapter 6: Resource Description and Access: Identifying manifestations and items
**** Organization of the description
**** core RDA elements 
**** Alternatives and options
**** LIC program for cooperative cataloging policy statements (LC-PCC PS)
**** transcription and recording
**** language and script

  + subject headings manual
    - guide to subject cataloging (in the same way RDA is used for descriptive cataloging)
  + SHs that ≠ appear in LCSH
    - headings in name authority file
    - headings w/free-floating phrases such as "metropolitan area" and "region"
    - certain music headings
    - headings w/free=floating subdivisions

- main headings: functions, types, syntax, & semantics p. 492
  + main headings are things, concept, process, activity, person, etc.
  + topical headings, form/genre, proper names
  + topical headings: MARC authority 150, 155
- Wu's slides: subject headings need to be uniform, unique, specific, consistent, current, and need to provide cross refs.

**** Definition
- _classification_: process of organizing knowledge into some systematic order.
  - identify distinctive things and group similar things
  - establish relationships among and making distinctions w/in classes
- _library classification_: used for shelving, display, collection mgmt
- 584: classification allows for more search control and achieving more relevant search results
- classificationist: theorist of classification
- classifier: user of classification system
**** Basic concepts
- _array_: group of elements that are at same level/stage
- _chain_: string of subjects of descending hierarchy
- _citation order_: order of facets
- _enumerative classification_: list all subjects. LCC.
- _facet analysis & synthesis_:
  - analysis: breaking up of subjects into component parts
  - synthesis: reassembling those parts as required by the doc. CC
- close vs. broad classification
**** Notation 587
- _pure notation_: only 1 type of symbol is used. e.g, DDC
- _mixed notation_: 1+ symbol used. e.g., LCC
- _hierarchical_: reflects structured order of classification
- _expressive_: expresses relationships among coordinate subjects
- many classification schemes have /internal mnemonics/
**** Components of a classification scheme
- schedule
- tables
- index
- additional documentation
**** How to classify
- classifying vs. assigning subject headings
|         | CLASSIFYING               | ASSIGNING SUBJ HEADINGS |
|---------+---------------------------+-------------------------|

|         | chosen for each work      | number of SHs           |
|         |                           |                         |
***** Choosing a number: general guidelines
- 
****** 1. consider usefulness
***** 2. make topic the primary consideration
***** 3. use the most specific # avail
***** do not classify from index alone
**** Choosing a #: Multitopical` works
***** 1. determine dominant topic or phase relations
- influence phase: a work is classified as 
- bias phase
- tool or application phase
- comparison phase
***** 2. class under first topic
***** 3. class under broader topic
*** Call numbers
*** MARC coding for classfiication and item #s
*** Modern library classification systems
*** Chapter 17: Library of congress classification
**** Introduction
- LCC: 21 classes in over 40 print schedules
- reasons to switch from DDC to LCC
  1. LCC's orientation toward research libs
  2. economic advantage of using LCC's cataloging service
  3. increasing ease w/which new records can be incorporated
**** History
- 3 element pattern
  + main class: single capital letter; subclass: 1-2 capital letters
  + subdivisions: arabic integers 1-9999
  + cutter #s for individ [[- [ ] fact checking due]] ual books

  This chapter provides information about how to develop and maintain a reference collection. Not only about acquisition, but weeding too. Lists the various resources needed to perform reference tasks well. Liked the point about being able to practice reference without perfection, since this will be a continually evolving field. 
  
  Most important seems to be ability to evaluate resources.
:END:
**** Know your community
- demographics
  + how: census reports, home languages, other data
- local opportunities/challenges to civic engagement
  + how: collaborate w/other government and service agencies
- economic opportunities
  + chaber of comerce
- physical environmental factors
- private tech access
**** Budget
- what to take into account, budget-wise
  + scope of library's ref service (factors include community size, other institutions that provide information assistance)
  + needs and expectations of the community
  + awareness of prevailing costs of needed resources
**** Ref sources shd include variety of formats
***** print & bound materials
- inclusion of print materials has to be justified as authoritative. i.e. if it's something that requires frequent updating, maybe not the best to have it in print.
- 4 criteria
  1. pertinent to community
  2. available only in print
  3. most accessible to potential users in print
  4. be most authoritative and accessible info on particular topic
- print materials to have on hand
  - latest american english dic
  - bilingual dictionary depending on community
  - local directory
  - handbooks in relevant disciplines
  - local area map
***** subscription databases
- selection criteria
  1. specific, authoritative, contributes to resources
  2. usability, incl responsive design
  3. media integration
  4. popularity w/community
  5. elegance
  6. best-buy evaluation
  7. integration with external proprietary content
  8. quality of original content
***** multimedia formats
***** make use of standard selection aids
**** Strive for balance re: subject area development
***** identifying experts as development resources
**** maintain the ref collection, not nec. its material pieces 
**** evaluating ref sources
- def: *evaluation*: measures authority and accessibility of the reference source 
  - aspects: organization, ease of use, accuracy and currency, scope, audience
***** print
***** databases
***** open web
- questions to ask:
  + who created site? are they experts?
  + purpose of site
  + upkeep and ada accessiblity?
  + how is the information presented? is it accessible and clear?
***** standing orders and subscriptions
- for standing orders, need to understand purpose of the work, each plan, and the relative space/budget needed to maintain plans
***** multimedia

- 54: Rhee saying aims and aspirations of the Korean people were identical to those of the American nation at the Korean Congress in PA, 1919. During the congress, they discussed how to frame an independent Korea as aligned with US interests in the region. Styling selves on American revolutionaries
- 61: Korea Review (magazine) - along w/League of Friends - demonstrated prominence of US Missionaries in Korean cause since March 1st uprising.
- 62: perception of US missionary orgs as "objective experts" on East Asia. Woodrow Wilson presidency - US missionaries had a prominent role in US Policy towartd east asia...
- 80: split btwn KPG officials -- Yi Tong-hwi wanted to shift KPG resources for military purposes in Manchuria and Siberia -- felt that Syngman Rhee's policy of diplomatic efforts hadn't shown any fruit.
- 108: appeal to US Legal system -- demonstrated that this "government" was actually civil society
- 109: "constructive Americanism" - Kilsoo Haan strategy, sought to demonstrate Koreans would be of use in combating Japanese threat at home & abroad
- 110: "Korean nationalism facilitated the development of a collective identity as ethnic Americans."
- 112: Haan switched strategy from lobbying US gov't to gaining trust of US military and tried to show how Japanese americans were engaging in anti-US activities
- 123: passage on decision re: Hawai'i's statehood status totally does not mention Native Hawaiian opposition to statehood. Only says that an overwhelming proportion of the (settler) population was in favor of it...Koreans opposed statehood b/c they thought it would give the Japanese too much power
- 152: Dunn (opponent of Rhee Syngman) indicates trend of entrusting US w/postwar planning of a liberated Korea 
- 161: "These difficulties of defining and achieving coherent political action under diasporic conditions posed a perpetual dilemma for the Korean nationalist movement thorughout its existence. The nationalist movement failed to establish a unified national state that could act with sovereign authority to respond to the needs and well-being of its national constituents in the diaspora. 
  Given these constraints, U.S.-based Koreans increasingly came to rely on the United States to act as a sovereign state to pursue the national interests of Koreans throughout the diaspora."

this text confuses me. does not seem super useful? much of the language seems similar to how the withering away of the state is described. 

- concentrated power = always wielded in interests of the few & at expense of the many
- "men are governed best when governed least"
- 6: cooperative communities, no permanent members of a continuous congress
- 4: pd of education precede any great fundamental Δ in society ... so the revolution is the end?

interesting look at power -- centralization as inherently oppressive. 


- decision making: 2
- pre-revolution: 3
- def of state:
   + 4: "a hierarchical and centralized institution that uses professionally organized violence to perform the function of reproducing class rule"
   + 5: state as hierarchical & authoritarian
   + 7: can't de-bureaucratize bc centralization necessarily means consolidation at the top -- but Bakunin's quote posits current electoral system, not that of freely elected and freely recallable positions at a worker's wage
- base/superstructure: 5
