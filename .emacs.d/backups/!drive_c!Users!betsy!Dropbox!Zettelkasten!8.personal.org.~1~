Simple Vinegar Rinse Recipe. Mix 1/2 to 4 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar
(ACV) with 8 ounces of water in a plastic squeeze bottle, spray bottle or other
container. Experiment to find a dilution that works best for your hair type (dry
hair likes less ACV and oily hair like more).* Books to read

** Ultimate Chocolate Chip cookie
*** Ingredients
- 1 C unsalted butter (2 sticks)
- 1 C brown sugar
- ¾ C granulated sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 1 ½ tsp. vanilla
- ½ tsp. salt
- 2 ½ C flour
- 1 ¼ tsp. baking soda
- 2 C walnuts coarsely chopped
- 3 C chocolate chips (18 oz.) 
*** Directions
1. Measure all ingredients. Let butter warm to room temperature. Sift the dry ingredients together a few times.
2. Beat butter in mixing bowl of a heavy duty mixer (such as a Kitchen Aid 4½ or 5-quart mixer) with flat (paddle) beater at medium speed until it is lighter and clings to bowl (30-45 seconds). Keeping beater at medium speed add both sugars in a steady stream. Continue to cream butter and sugars for 4-5 minutes, scraping down bowl twice. When done the mixture will be light in color and fluffy in appearance.
3. Whisk eggs with vanilla in small bowl and add to butter and sugar mixture, keeping beater on medium speed. Be careful to pour in the eggs very slowly. It should take 3-4 minutes to add the eggs. The mixture then appears fluffy, looking like whipped cream cheese. (This is the "creaming method" for making a butter cake, which I learned from Flo Braker's The Simple Art of Perfect Baking.)
4. Put beater on slowest speed and add dry ingredients. As soon as the dry ingredients are incorporated, add chocolate chips and walnuts. Leave beater on lowest speed for a few seconds to mix it all together.
5. (The best chocolate chips around are from the Guittard Chocolate Company, but you cannot find these at all grocery stores. Sometimes I replace ½ of the chocolate chips with either peanut butter chips, raspberry chips, or mint chips. The latter two I often find in the grocery store around Christmas.)
6. Make into golf ball sized balls and place on cookie sheet right next to each other. (I use an ice cream scoop to measure each cookie.) This should make about 30-35 cookies. (I put 5 rows of 7 cookies on a 17-inch by 11-inch cookie sheet.) Put in fridge overnight or for at least 6 hours, covered. Remove and let warm to room temperature (30 min.). Put cookie balls on baking sheet to bake. Flatten a little to resemble a hockey puck, about 3/4-inch high. Make edges go straight up and down. Make a slight depression in center with finger.
7. Bake at 400 degrees, 8-10 minutes. Edges should be golden brown but center 1-inch pale. Let sit at room temperature 5 minutes before taking off baking pan.

** [2016-11-04 Fri]
Went to Mt Ranier with James, Gomo, and Gomo-bu.
Next time go to carbon or one of the other non-paradise entrances


** Mt Ranier
*** Please note that the address listed below is the physical address for the park administration building and should not be used for GPS systems. Instead use the address 39000 State Route 706 E, Ashford, WA 98304. This will take you on SR 706 east past the Administration Building to the Nisqually Entrance. It is recommended that visitors refer to road maps in addition to using GPS units when driving to the park.

*** areas: paradise; sunrise
1. Chase Waterfalls: There are plenty of waterfalls to seek out when visiting Mount Rainier National Park, but one to add to your list is Silver Falls. The waterfall is fairly-easily accessible via the three-mile loop Silver Falls Trail, which meanders through old-growth forest, in which you may spot woodpeckers, deer and other wildlife, as well as fly fishermen casting their lines along the Ohanapecosh River.

2. Get Face-to-Face with the Mountains: For some amazing mountain views, take some time to traverse the four-mile, family-friendly Sourdough Ridge Trail in the Sunrise Area of the park. In addition to stunning views, you may also spot wildflowers and cute little marmots along the way.

3. Explore a Rainforest: Of the 236,000 acres that comprise Mount Rainier National Park, approximately 58% is forested, and the types of forests vary, including an inland temperate rainforest in the Carbon River area of the park. Between 70 and 90 inches of rain fall within the forest, resulting in long-hanging moss, ferns as far as the eye can see and towering Douglas firs overhead. You’re sure to feel like you’re in a fairy tale within the forest.
*** road status
**** Carbon River Road	OPEN
No vehicles are permitted beyond the park entrance; bicycle and pedestrian traffic only.
**** SR 410/123 (Cayuse Pass) North boundary to south boundary	
OPEN
Tentatively estimated to close for the season November 21, weather dependent.

NOTE: Starting September 19, expect minor delays due to rockfall mitigation work on the SR 123 tunnel. A traffic signal will be in place to help guide traffic.

Commercial vehicles prohibited at all times. For more information, check the Washington State Dept. of Transportation (WSDOT) or call 1-800-695-ROAD (7623) toll-free statewide or 206-DOT-HIWY (368-4499) in the greater Seattle area.

**** SR 410 (Chinook Pass)	
OPEN
Tentatively estimated to close for the season November 21, weather dependent.

Commercial vehicles prohibited at all times. For more information, check the Washington State Dept. of Transportation (WSDOT) or call 1-800-695-ROAD (7623) toll-free statewide or 206-DOT-HIWY (368-4499) in the greater Seattle area.

**** Nisqually Entrance to Longmire	OPEN
Longmire to Paradise	OPEN
May close nightly due to weather. Check Twitter for gate status and other road condition updates (Twitter account not required to view).
When we go it is almost always for a day trip from Seattle. I leave about 7am. Get to the entrance to the park (the Nisqually entrance). The drive in along the river through the forest is beautiful. You can stop at Longmire where there is a visitor center and museum and woodland trails or continue first to Paradise (which is my preference). The way up stop for Narada falls and anywhere else you want to take pics. At Paradise see the visitor center and maybe do a hike. If you didn't see Longmire on the way up see it on the way down. If you don't plan a significant hike at Paradise you could also drive on through to Ohanapecosh and do the short Grove of the Patriarch's trail.

Go to Mt. Rainier national park. Drive up to Paradise and look around - but don't hike there - it is all hilly.
Then go around to the east side of the park on Hwy 410 to Naches Peak and hike the Naches Peak loop. It is an easy hike although a couple of miles long, with great views.

EDIT: Just got back from Mount Rainier...had an awesome day! Hiked through Paradise, Grove of the Patriarchs, and a few other really short ones. Plus we took the Gondola ride at Crystal Mountain which was definitely worth it (though we went late in the day and Rainier was pretty hazy). Thanks for the help everyone!



Nisqually

Located in the southwest corner of the park via SR 706, the Nisqually Entrance provides year-round access to the park. Open daily. NOTE: To reach the Nisqually entrance using GPS use the address 39000 State Route 706 E, Ashford, WA 98304. Fee station with fee kiosk available for after hours.

** La Conner

This historic town edging Swinomish Channel is a good base for exploring the rich and scenic farmland of the Skagit Valley, an hour north of Seattle.

La Conner is a compact town with galleries and interesting shops, ranging from The Wood Merchant’s locally made wooden furniture to a shop selling 140 varieties of olives. Home today to luminaries such as author Tom Robbins, the town in the past was an enclave of famed “Northwest School” artists from Mark Tobey to Guy Anderson, whose legacy is celebrated in La Conner’s Museum of Northwest Art (www.museumofnwart.org).

A recent addition: the first phase of a new waterfront boardwalk edging downtown shops, offering an up-close view of the salty channel edged by fishing boats, log rafts and classic sailboats, as well as a summertime procession of yachts on their way to and from the nearby San Juan Islands.

Getting there: From Interstate 5 about 60 minutes north of Seattle, take Exit 221, go west through the town of Conway and follow signs toward La Conner.

** bellingham
Getting There 45 minutes: south on I-5

Old and new are mashed up together in the ever-growing anorthern city. The oldest brick building in the state is located here (though uncelebrated by historic signage), as is the alternative culture mecca of Western Washington University. History nerds flock to the Bellingham Railway Museum and the American Museum of Radio and Electricity, both celebrating cultural game-changers. Things get more contemporary at Mindport, an institution dedicated to interactive science and art; it’s the kind of place where you can create music using marbles. Nothing’s stuffy in this funky coastal town; even the Whatcom Museum, in the gothic Old City Hall, gets dynamic with summertime historic cruises. Delightfully strange combinations aren’t merely the purview of Bellingham’s learned institutions—at Mallard Ice Cream near the American Museum of Radio and Electricity, old-fashioned methods are used to create newfangled flavors.

** Washington Park Arboretum

On the shores of Lake Washington, Washington Park Arboretum covers 230 acres and includes mainly native trees and shrubs in a beautifully landscaped setting. April to October are the best months to visit, though the facility is open year round. The city and the University of Washington run Washington Park Arboretum jointly. Also within the arboretum, the Japanese Garden was created in 1960. This mature garden offers a fabulous display of flowers in the spring and throughout the summer. Hours and admission at the Japanese Garden differ from the arboretum.
