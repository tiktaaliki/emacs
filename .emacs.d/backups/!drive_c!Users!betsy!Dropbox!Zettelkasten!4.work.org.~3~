* Grammar notes
coordinating conjunctions	Use commas to separate two or more coordinate adjectives that describe the same noun. Be sure never to add an extra comma between the final adjective and the noun itself or to use commas with non-coordinate adjectives.
	Coordinate adjectives are adjectives with equal ("co"-ordinate) status in describing the noun; neither adjective is subordinate to the other. You can decide if two adjectives in a row are coordinate by asking the following questions:
	        • Does the sentence make sense if the adjectives are written in reverse order?
	        • Does the sentence make sense if the adjectives are written with and between them?
	If you answer yes to these questions, then the adjectives are coordinate and should be separated by a comma. Here are some examples of coordinate and non-coordinate adjectives:
	He was a difficult, stubborn child. (coordinate)
	They lived in a white frame house. (non-coordinate)
	She often wore a gray wool shawl. (non-coordinate)
	Your cousin has an easy, happy smile. (coordinate)
	The 1) relentless, 2) powerful 3) summer sun beat down on them. (1-2 are coordinate; 2-3 are non-coordinate.)
	The 1) relentless, 2) powerful, 3) oppressive sun beat down on them. (Both 1-2 and 2-3 are coordinate.)

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am applying for the Pharmacy Technician position at CVS/pharmacy. I have 10 years of experience as a pharmacy technician. From 1994–2000, I worked at the Medicine Shoppe. Then, I moved to the Boston area for college where I worked at CVS/pharmacy from 2000–2004, first in Newton, MA, and then in Roxbury, MA. While working at CVS/pharmacy I earned my PTCB certification. 

My most recent experiences as an Associate Editor at the Community College Research Center and as an Editor at Yoon Editing have honed my attention to detail and communication skills. Previous to that I worked as an administrative assistant at the Community College Research Center and have excellent interpersonal and customer service skills.

I am seeking to change careers and would love to once again be part of the CVS/pharmacy team while I attend graduate school for library science. I look forward to hearing from you. 

Thank you for your time. 

Sincerely,

Betsy Yoon

Dear Ms Bridget Salvato,

I am applying for the Library Information Assistant position at the Richmondtown New York Public Library branch in Staten Island. I earned a BA in English from Boston College in 2004 and a Master of International Affairs from Columbia University in 2010. I am implementing a career change from editing and publication work to library science and would love this opportunity to gain hands-on library experience. 

In my six years as Associate Editor at the Community College Research Center (CCRC), I was responsible for preparing CCRC research for publication and dissemination, including editing, proofing, and formatting. This experience honed my attention to detail, as well was working efficiently and effectively within time constraints. I have over 10 years of editing experience and have excellent written and verbal communication skills. I also developed superb organization skills. For example, I created and maintained a large database of references to streamline the editing process. During my time, I participated in developing the website, which included cataloging CCRC's existing research from 1996 to ensure that our publications would be easily accessible to the public.

In my role as Co-Director of the Korea Education and Exposure Program (KEEP), run by Nodutdol for Korean Community Development, I have accrued 5 years of experience with community training, programming, and outreach. I have conducted workshops on Korean history and current events, outreached to college students and other interested parties, and maintained and developed the KEEP program. This program takes delegates (drawn from a nationwide applicant pool) to North and South Korea in alternating years. This past year, my co-director and I initiated a strategic planning process to fundamentally rethink and improve the program to meet the evolving needs of the participants and our hosts. Preparing for these trips includes a series of study sessions and workshops to prepare the delegates for the trip. 

I have spoken to many librarians regarding my plans to earn a degree in library science, and all have stressed the importance of practical experience. I am eager to learn more about the library system and would love this opportunity to serve both the New York Public Library and the community it serves.
