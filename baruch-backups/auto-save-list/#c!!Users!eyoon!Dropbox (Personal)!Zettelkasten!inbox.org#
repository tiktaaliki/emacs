** daily tejaniya
- [ ] My teacher would always ask me how I was practicing, and that is what I'm asking you now. What are you doing? What is special or different today? Yogis who are practicing will have an answer; those who *are not practicing will not.
- [ ] When we stay continuously aware without focusing, we notice that objects appear to come and go, come and go. We just stay aware. Don't think of this as a waste of time. The mind is collecting data so that at some point in the future, when all the data come together, understanding will arise.
- [ ] Agitation is interesting. When it arises, you could ask: "What is agitation like?" Instead of trying to make* *it go away, allow it to be fully present, so that you can watch and learn its nature clearly. If it weren't present you couldn't study or learn, so think of* * its presence as an opportunity. *
- [ ] *Most people use a lot of energy when they* *are meditating because they are afraid of their thoughts or* * want to avoid them, or stop them. But you cannot make the mind not think. If* *you are trying to stop the mind from* *thinking, you are trying to do the impossible. That is when you* *start using a lot of energy. *
- [ ] *Tension never takes hold in the mind alone. If there is tension in the mind as a result of the unwholesome* *roots (greed, hatred, delusion), then it* *will be reflected in tension somewhere in the body. Consciously relaxing these physical tensions is a kind of meditation.*
- [ ] Check yourself often: are you tense or relaxed? Check the mind and the body. Any tension in the mind or body indicates you are likely wanting something; disliking something and wanting it to go away; or feeling conused about something.
- [ ] Learn to be interested in difficult situations. By being present with them in a gentle manner, you may suddenly * * understand what caused them.*
- [ ] A certain feeling of eagerness accompanies the desire to eat. Awareness is either very weak or not present in the presence of this strong eagerness. How is the mind while you are eating? Is it relaxed? Check regularly that you are not eating with eagerness.
- [ ] If a person says something that makes you angry, that's their business. There is never a good reason to be angry. Instead of attaching to the words that arouse your anger, get interested in your reactivity instead. Study and learn.
- [ ]*YOGI: A few years back, at a meditation retreat, we were at a campsite with lots of mosquitoes. I found that if I meditated on the feeling of itchiness, that the feeling increased. *  *SAYADAW: When I say to observe unpleasant feelings, I am not talking about observing the itchiness. I am talking about the aversion to the feeling of itchiness. It is a feeling in the mind, of not wanting to experience or to watch the itchiness. That feeling inside is a feeling of pushing away, of not wanting. That is the feeling to observe, not the physical sensations of itchiness.
- [ ] *Don't fight with craving. Don't say it should or shouldn't be this way. The right attitude is to focus on the presence of awareness. You could say something like:* *"Never mind if it is still happening, at least I see it now. I'm not being blindly led by craving. I might not be able yet to get * *a handle on it completely, but I can * *learn something from it." *
- [ ] *YOGI: For me, goal-setting is a positive trait, but I realize it can be greed, too. So then I try to stop myself and it becomes a mental battle which is exhausting. How can I improve? *SAYADAW: The effort to reach a goal is a positive quality. The moment that you recognize greed, that's still fine. It's when you think that you shouldn't have greed that you have gone wrong. *
- [ ] * YOGI: * * If you have a sensory pleasure, you tend to crave it. But if you try to avoid it, that's aversion. How do you resolve this? *  *SAYADAW: * *You recognize what is happening in the present moment. If there is craving, you recognize that craving is happening. If there is aversion, you recognize that. Then you observe everything you can about the craving, or the aversion. What does it feel like? * *What does it do? What are its results? *
- [ ] *Many yogis are not yet adept in* *meditating while looking, seeing, and* *talking, as they haven't had much prac-* *tice in these areas. But keeping your eyes* *closed or open is not what is important. * *What is key is whether the mind is* *wholesome or unwholesome. *
- [ ] *At these times we need to take strength from tiny moments. Take a moment to go within yourself. Meditate, * * don't think. Don't think of anything. Take the moment to just drop into the present moment and gather your mind. This is* where concentration practice is very helpful.
- [ ] *Keep your attention on yourself when you're listening to someone speak. This means staying with your awareness of everything that's happening in your mind and body as you listen. Notice your thoughts, your feelings, your * *posture, your breath, your facial expression, how you are holding your arms and hands. Everything! Notice everything * *you can. Be interested and learn.*
- [ ] [[https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgzGmtXDcwBmKjgNFfBDLhTwftFdD][The Daily Tejaniya for Jan. 18: There is No Body, No Person - betsy.yoon@gmail.com - Gmail]] With right view we are aware of what is happening in the pres- ent moment. We are experiencing nature happening. There is no body, no person. If we take this attitude and we are aware of what is hap- pening, then we have right view and right thought.
- [ ] [[https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgzGmtXCStWzPsNBFWCgCqvQHrkTj][The Daily Tejaniya for Jan. 17: Once We Understand Anger, It Abates - betsy.yoon@gmail.com - Gmail]] We need to understand the nature of anger, the thought processes that lead to this   upsurge of emotion. Ask questions of yourself: "Why was the mind not angry before,   but now it is? What activity has made the   the mind angry?" Whatever level of understanding we come to, the anger will   decrease by that same amount.
- [ ] [[https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgzGmtXCRMBbjKwJQHGGRPQGCbgrS][The Daily Tejaniya for Jan. 16: We Must Look at Life As It Is - betsy.yoon@gmail.com - Gmail]] *First, we must ask ourselves: what is our relationship to reality? What is our understanding of life? We must look at life as it is, and come into intimate contact with life.*
- [ ] [[https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgzGmtNkTFTfzvtQTFzrKNVXHVNWN][The Daily Tejaniya for Jan. 13: Wanting to Understand is Wisdom - betsy.yoon@gmail.com - Gmail]] Wanting to understand is wisdom; wanting a result is greed.
- [ ] [[https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgzGmtNhCBMBFGkHDlDNGXNXGWSWR][The Daily Tejaniya for Jan. 11: Emotions Are Never Your Emotions - betsy.yoon@gmail.com - Gmail]] *When you investigate emotions it is important that you remind yourself that they are natural phenomena. They are not /your/ emotions; everybody experiences them**.*
- [ ] [[https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgzGmtNWwGPnLSCgdccBwmngDcflf][The Daily Tejaniya for Jan. 4: Every Experience is a Tool to Develop Wisdom - betsy.yoon@gmail.com - Gmail]] Let any experience arise. Greed, hatred and delusion are objects like any other. Because we are getting to know them, there is no need to fear them. Just know they are there. They are tools for you to fur- ther develop wisdom.
- [ ] [[https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgzGmtFFxpfLhFHBVwbQQZWqnWnGb][The Daily Tejaniya for Jan. 1: Every Moment is Always New - betsy.yoon@gmail.com - Gmail]] *Nothing is ever the same, every moment is always new. Once you can really see this, your mind will always be interested in whatever it observes. No mo- ment will ever be boring because your ex- perience shows that "things" are forever changing. You don't get tired of know- ing, as knowing is never finished. This work is for life.*
- [ ] [[https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgzGmtDzNhNCHjJFGsPNGWBvHjbjz][The Daily Tejaniya for Dec. 28: Don't Try to Avoid Objects or Experiences - betsy.yoon@gmail.com - Gmail]] Don't try to avoid objects or experiences; try to avoid getting entangled in greed, hatred and delusion.
- [ ] [[https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgzGmtDxFfjKGbjWKDXFdbTkgvCZB][The Daily Tejaniya for Dec. 27: Quiet and Unquiet Mind Are Equal in Meditation - betsy.yoon@gmail.com - Gmail]] A quiet mind is some- thing we can be aware of; it is an object. An unquiet mind is also an object. So from the meditation point of view, as objects, they are equal.
- [ ] [[https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgzGllVjtRfcxcQkmGXBRbrwCXCxG][The Daily Tejaniya for Dec. 15: When You Recognize the Unwholesome, That's Wholesome - betsy.yoon@gmail.com - Gmail]] Be sure to recognize that when you recognize something unwholesome, the very recognition that there is something unwholesome, is itself wholesome.

Facilitating breakthrough
Transformative facilitation needs to happen in conjunction with wider political change. These conflicts don't just happen because ppl can't see the other person. There are structural factors that make this happen. Eg the Guatemala stuff -- all that stuff is bc of the United States

It’s back! The LACUNY Professional Development Committee is accepting applications for the Spring 2022 LACUNY Professional Development Travel Grant:
** THREE grants of up to $600 each will be awarded to LACUNY members with Full Membership for the purpose of attending library-related conferences, meetings, or events that take
 place during Spring 2022 or after.
** Proposals will be blind-reviewed.
** This is not a PSC-CUNY Research Awards travel grant. It is separate from any funds which may be available through a particular college or department for faculty travel—the
 availability of such funds plays no role in the roundtable's decision-making.
** Deadline for submission is March 18, 2022 (11:59 PM EST).
** Please carefully read the Grant Award Guidelines below before applying as they have changed.

Please submit your application online here [docs.google.com].

​Grant Application:

Applications will be evaluated on the following criteria:

1 Proposals should be no longer than 500 words (applications submitted with more than 500 words will not be considered), explaining how presenting or participating in a particular
 contributing role, other than as audience, can benefit the applicant in his/her professional development, and will be evaluated according to these categories*:
** The rubric is based on 21 points: categories 1 through 4 are 5 points each (where 1 is the lowest score and 5 is the best score) and category 5 will receive either a 1 for yes or 0 for no.

●       Category 1: How does attendance further LACUNY's mission?

●       Category 2: Are the objectives of the proposal clearly communicated?

●       Category 3: How does attendance contribute to areas of special focus within CUNY libraries?

●       Category 4: How does attendance help the participant explore new trends in the field?

●       Category 5: Is the candidate selected as a speaker/presenter in Conference (formal acceptance letter/proof of invitation, or email correspondence, from organization sponsoring the
conference/meeting mandatory)?

2 Budget: The inclusion of a detailed budget indicating the following

●       Estimation of travel expenses (by most economical method)

●       Air

●       Train

●       Car

●       Other

●       Meals

●       Lodging

●       Registration fee

●       Local travel (to/from the destination train/bus station or airport, or between venues)

Rules and Eligibility:

●       THREE grants of up to $600 each will be awarded to LACUNY members with Full Membership for the purpose of attending library-related conferences, meetings, or events that take
place during Spring 2022 or after.  Applicants must be LACUNY Members with Full membership as of March 18, 2022 (PayPal or checks received, not postmarked). Applications which do
not meet membership requirements will not be considered.

●       LACUNY Full Membership [lacuny.org] is open to anyone on the staff of the City University libraries holding a master's degree in library science from an accredited institution, and
to anyone holding a Master's degree in educational technology or a Master's degree in computer science.

●       Proposals will be blind-reviewed.

●       Awards will not be given to more than one person from each institution.

●       Past grant awardees ARE eligible to apply two full years after they have won.

●       Availability—or lack of availability—of travel funds at local colleges or library departments are not considered.

●       This is not a PSC-CUNY Research Awards travel grant. It is separate from any funds which may be available through a particular college or department for faculty travel—the
availability of such funds plays no role in the roundtable's decision-making.  Deadline for submission is March 18, 2022 (11:59 PM EST).

Important Information:

●       It is advised that you have a draft of your proposal reviewed for input by a supportive senior colleague prior to submitting.

●       It is important that you demonstrate the impact the conference/event will have on your work when you return.

●       Awardees will need to submit a summary report soon after returning from the conference to co-chairs of the Professional Development Roundtable.

●       Awardees will receive detailed instructions regarding reimbursement of expenses with their notification.

1) In sharing your political autobiography within Nodutdol, how did you/did you reframe and politicize your personal and family history? What did you notice?

2) What are the interactions and tensions between the individual versus collective, and personal versus private life, in the creation of “social memory” and collective/national identity? Where does diasporic identity fit into this picture?

3) How can Nodutdol (especially through our propaganda committee) create an intentional collective history/narrative within diasporic Koreans in North America? How can we be sensitive to the gendered aspects (and other nuances) in creating collective histories and memories?
* [2022-02-25 Fri] Meet with Linda re: classroom observation
I should add ... In the pre-observation meeting, we discuss your course (goals, delivery, etc.), select a date for the observation, discuss the goals/content/activities you will cover in your class on that observation day, and any concerns or issues about the class that you would like me to know about before the observation. For example, are there issues with the room you are teaching in, etc.

* [2022-02-25 Fri] meeting with arthur
Thanks for the clarification. I'm wondering how fine grained we have to be about this? For example, I recall you indicated that we are meant to be available to students who need consultations outside of our regular work hours. In those instances, should we be updating you when we are working outside of the work schedule, and what hours we're subtracting from our regular hours? E.g., if I meet with a student on the weekend and so come in a bit later on Monday? I know Linda had a workshop request that was from 6-9 pm, and there was another request that was something like 7-9 am. These are also outside of our regular hours, do they need to be approved in advance? Or does that just apply when it's a whole day thing?

A similar case is last year, when we were asked to cover a few weekend reference dates -- I just kept Harry informed of my swap day (I came in on a Saturday, and switched it out with a weekday)-- was this something I was supposed to keep you in the loop on? And if such a thing arises again, the procedure is to confirm with you first? I just want to make sure I am clear on all the procedures so I don't break any rules without realizing it!

On a separate note, the reason I had asked you about my reassigned time was because I was having trouble getting all the work done for courses and consultations while also taking weekly reassigned time, and being able to use them over the summer is preferable to trying to squeeze them in when I don't quite have the time or ability to use them at the moment. I was worried that if I didn't use them this semester, I would lose them, but based on your email, it sounds like it's perfectly OK to use them in the summer, so long as they are scheduled in conjunction with you? I'm fine with figuring out appropriate scheduling for the summer if that is the main issue. I would also like to use the spring break week to use those hours, let me know if this is OK.


Check in with Charlie

We try to avoid taking it during the summer.
Guidelines around policies wrt faculty don't trnslate well to library.

Arthur will talk to Gerry
Can carry it over

write up to Arthur when I want to take my research leave during the summer

arthur doesn't like to get into scheduling ppl's times
the college, university, state, and city are all concerned w/ppl being back to work as a way to revive the economy

had to send an email message to everyone

more of a concern w/staff who are not faculty.

don't work more than 35 hours a week

go to GSA travel website
pick a city, it will tell me what the lodging rate is for the city in that month. when i apply for travel approval, amount requesting shouldn't exceed that.

separate category for meals
that's the rate i should calculate

3 meals per day, but don't get reimbursed for lunch, b/c state assumes you're going something about your lunch when you work

can claim breakfast & dinner on travel days, depending on time you arrive and get home.

need receipts for everything




should i make a report of faculty committee
registration fee gets refunded at the end?


kimmy has a lot of experience with this!


going forward, to get funding, need to have some level of involvement other than attending

need to submit all receipts and claim for reimbursement when i get back on the 29th, right away.


when we're talking about reports from other curriculum committees, jump in and say i couldn't make the curriculum committee

Librarianship: dismantle white supremacy & how it manifests in our libraries via architecture, collection development, teaching and learning practices

Integrating criticalities of race
- how do we reify power structures of racial inequity in library services, school, & staffing models?
- how do we continue to support ourselves, faculty, students, patrons, & the public?




--------

Welcome!

Thank you to Shawn, Liam, and Linda for this opportunity and I look forward to hearing everyone's thoughts during the Q&A


About myself: My formal academic instructional experience is quite limited. This is my first time teaching a college level course. Prior to this, I had only conducted a single one-shot workshop. This is also just my second semester at Baruch, so there was a bit of a feeling of being tossed in the deep end of the pool. I contrast this with my pedagogical experiences in political and community education.
--------------------
Opening points / framing the case study

I'm not sure if the stuff I'm going to talk about fits exactly the framework of CRT, so I appreciate the organizers for being interested in hearing about my case study. I have appreciated hearing from the other talks.

My practice is focused on a systematic understanding of structures of oppression in order to enact material change toward liberation. I think in any conversation about criticality, I consider it is essential to be mindful that what is not important is necessarily the specifics of a given paradigm, but a shared commitment to enacting material change for the purposes of liberation--otherwise, it's just talk.

I want to share a few quotes to open:
--------------
In their work, "The University and the Undercommons", Moten and Harney are critical of the critical academic. "Does the questioning of the critical academic not become a pacification?"

The authors open their piece saying that "The only possible relationship to the university today is a criminal one."

Juxtaposed with this quote I am hoping to emphasize that criticality is perhaps a necessary but not sufficient condition for liberation.
--------------
In Sam Popowich's "Confronting the Democratic Discourse of Librarianship", he writes "Throughout this book, progressive, radical, and critical librarianship will periodically appear as, ostensibly, an antagonist to dominant liberal ideology. I will argue, however, that these movements end up safely recuperated within the hegemonic structures of contemporary capitalism."

While Popowich is talking about critical librarianship, I think this observation applies to the genre of criticality more broadly.
--------------
I also wish to discuss Joy James's concept of the captive maternal.

Joy James gave voice to the concept of the "Captive Maternal" -- a concept originating in chattel slavery, the captive maternal is an ungendered subject "whose very existence enables the possessive empire that claims and dispossesses them."

She describes 4 stages of the captive maternal,
stage 1: conflicted. stabilizing predatory structures.
stage 2: move into a movement arena
stage 3: maroonage. create a cadre inside industry that's disciplined.
stage 4: war resister

play quote

so, she says it's important to know what stage we are in. i think a lot of librarianship and library discourse exist in stage 1, and that it's important to understand that those other stages exist, and that there's a reason james didn't just stop at stage 1. it is a recognition that we are in a state of war, and that effective zones of liberation need to be established within the framework of understanding this larger context.

I bring in the concept of the captive maternal and want to juxtapose it with Fobazi Ettarh's concept of vocational awe. I think vocational awe can be a mechanism to keep librarians within stage 1, where our labor is used to reinforce and prop up oppressive structures.

I think CRT in libraries is one way in which librarians can try to move away from stage 1 into the more collectively oriented stage 2.
----------------
It is important when having these discussions to establish the scope of our aims.

Point #1: It is impossible to dismantle white supremacy within libraries without dismantling the larger structures in which it exists
- libraries are a reflection of the larger society in which they exist. the idea that they can be otherwise is a symptom of vocational awe

Point #2: it is impossible to dismantle white supremacy without dismantling capitalism. racial capitalism, coined by cedric robinson, does not denote a particular type of capitalism and to imply that there is a capitalism that does not rely on racial oppression, but rather to explicitly demonstrate the fundamental ways in which racialism and capitalism evolved together into racial capitalism
----------------------
Zak Cope's Divided World, Divided Class:
"...racism is the ideological expression of a system of profoundly unequal economic and political relations. To oppose racist thinking means to *render it inoperative* by practically abolishing those social institutions which accord it significance."
----------------------
A friend of mine defended his dissertation on Tuesday. His dissertation is titled
"Queer Korean Diaspora: An Ethnography of Geopolitics". In the Q&A, when asked what people can do, he said, "End imperialism."

Case study details

The course:
Course description in the school catalog:
- This course examines the nature, production, value and uses of information in historical perspective; the latest development in information technology; the ways information is produced and disseminated and how they affect business, politics, media, science, arts and culture; the growth of the information society, and major information policy issues.

describe:
- 3 credit
- cross listing
- undergraduate

The course has been taught by multiple library faculty over the years and its design can and has been interpreted in a variety of ways according to the interests of the instructor. My intention is to develop an environment in which students feel empowered to enact change by practicing materialist (as opposed to idealist) analysis of our current information context.


----------------
the students
- 24 students ranging from 1st through 4th year students
- transfer students
- 70% have full or part-time jobs
- Baruch offers an information minor, so a number of students are in the class for that reason
- while some are in the class b/c they are interested in the topic of information and society, most are taking it to fulfill needed credits and not out of any particular interest.

-------------


---------------------

In order to make these conversations and discussion accessible to undergraduate students, the course relies heavily on course discussion and frequent low-stakes assignments that prioritize reflection and processing. I also emphasize connections to their primary discipline as one way to practice applying a critical approach to information to contexts outside of this course.



---------------------

within the space of capitalism, which is structurally reliant on racial oppression, it will be impossible to eliminate

are we part of a liberation struggle? or are we captive maternals, where by protecting ourselves & our community, we are enabling the system to function?


proposal


This case study details an approach to a 3-credit, undergraduate course at Baruch College titled "Information and Society." The course has been taught by multiple library faculty over the years and its design can and has been interpreted in a variety of ways according to the interests of the instructor. My intention is to develop an environment in which students feel empowered to enact change by practicing materialist (as opposed to idealist) analysis of our current information context.

The course first looks at the larger structures that shape the production and dissemination of information (capitalism, imperialism, neoliberalism, settler colonialism, racism), then at how various information institutions (the media, the state, libraries, and universities) and narratives (democracy and openness) can serve to uphold oppressive strctures.


While I have a strong background in community-based political education, this is my first time teaching a college-level course. In addition, I began my position at Baruch during the pandemic. This course has been a great learning opportunity (as well as a source of great stress) and I welcome the opportunity to engage with the larger community of critical practitioners to learn and reflect on my own practice.


The reason I titled this presentation "A materialist approach to information and society" is because one of my aims is to equip students with fundamentals of dialectical materialism as a way to approach understanding information and society. What is essential is understanding the importance of systems change and one's understanding society as a collective.

I think the term critical race theory is used these days in multiple ways, just as various criticalities (critical pedagogy, critical librarianship) are used in multiple ways. This is not to say we need to strictly define what this type of criticality is to move forward.

Today's meeting

- incentive budgeting: current budgeting is incremental. last year + or - a percentage. distributed proportionally. a good year with good revenue is shared equally across the college. IBB changes this distribution to benefit units that are the source of revenue.
  + eg: budget of 3 schools and looking at where students are enrolled nad majored, then marxe gets disproportionate amount of total revenue. marxe is being subsidized.
  + distributions will be more obvious
  + Q is now, how will new dean ensure marxe grows its sources of revenue. collaboration across schools.
  + preliminary discussion is looking at different models. apply a model next fiscal year
  + only CUNY and Hunter have had enrollment growth in the past few years.
  + library is going to be funded out of overhead.
  + we have to demonstrate our value to the college, demonstrate how the library is a good investment.
  + we need to pay attn to what provost, president, and schools are saying about how we can be valuable to them.

\\

Hello Juyeon and other NDD folks,

\\

Here are our purpose and goals for the Pocantico retreat. And the link to the venue.

[[https://www.rbf.org/pocantico]]\\

\\

We received a grant to use the facility, so your member would only have to prove their own travel expenses.

All the meals and lodging will be provided.

Purpose: Why are we bringing people together for this retreat?

To bring together key leaders from advocacy, grassroots, and messaging sectors of Korea peace work to

1) have an honest conversation about the current political reality,

2) give clarity to all existing work,

3) find out areas of overlap/intersection,

4) revisit the foundations of shared Korea peace work and update our understanding of what's possible 5) achieve as much buy-in among participants as possible.

*What do we want to come out of it?*

• Identify shared analysis of present political reality

• Presentations summarizing what the work has looked like up until this point (this is so everyone has a shared understanding of what already exists and what may need to be revisited or built upon)

• Shared understanding of goals (70th anniversary of Armistice): is it a peace agreement? Is it an end-of-war declaration? What are we collectively pushing for?

• Agree on shared theory of change to achieve those goals

• Agree on who we need to move in order to achieve the goals we set for 2023 (Biden admin, etc.). This should include a list of stakeholders we have not yet engaged, or not yet sufficiently engaged, and a unified strategy for how to engage them (i.e., Korean War vets?)

• Discussion on how supplemental issues and lines of effort (travel ban, military exercises, feminist peace, sanctions, etc.) interacts with the core goal of achieving a Korea peace agreement, and how those efforts are embedded in the Korea peace strategy.

• Brainstorm potential blue-sky joint activities in support of our goals, and come to agreement on which pieces can be moved forward and who is leading them.

\\

We are inviting 8 people from the policy/advocacy, 8~10 from the grassroots, and 6~7 WCDMZ staff.

The max capacity is 25, I think, so we are right there.

\\

Can you let me know who can attend from NDD by Tuesday?

\\

Thank you so much!!

This is an experimental body and still defining itself. things are inchoate.
* Faculty resources
Based on our conversation, it should be:
- able to receive new submissions/resources
- usable by both faculty and students
- organized thematically (and not by course week)
* [2022-04-04 Mon] Meeting with Arad

I'd like to address your participation in this course. Both in the classroom and in your discussion posts, both of which count toward your participation grade.

Your participation in this course has been dismissive and disrespectful to me and the other students. On the first day of class, you expressed your unwillingness to abide by our community agreements and have since engaged with both me and your classmates accordingly. I'm once again asking you to abide by our shared expectations and community agreements, and I also want to remind you that, as stated in the syllabus, these impact your participation grade.

Appropriate conduct in an academic setting will differ from appropriate conduct in a social setting, and so forth. Appropriate conduct for an instructor is different from appropriate conduct from a student.

The college academic classroom is intended to be an environment for students to respectfully and safely explore ideas and experiences. It's not a place for mockery and disrespect. My department chair has recommended that if disrespectful behavior toward other students continues, that I reach out to Brandy Peer, Associate Director of Community Standards, Office of the Dean of Students




Ask him how he can express his thoughts and ask questions to promote a continued and positive exploration. Remind him how the classroom is open to various viewpoints, including challenging content and contradictory viewpoints, but the goal is not to entertain, shock, disrupt, heckle, or end the discussion ... or to "be right" and win an argument. One can challenge content or ask about challenging content. One should communicate various viewpoints as a positive contribution to the class, though.

An environment for students to respectfully and safely explore ideas and experiences. This can include presenting/raising conflicting ideas, opinions, and questions in a thoughtful, respectful manner. Student participation should positively contribute to ongoing classroom discussions and activities, it should not end or disrupt them. Discourteous jokes, eye rolling, laughing, and statements made to "shock" others are behaviors which end or disrupt classroom activities, and can negatively impact a classroom participation grade.
** feedback from Linda, Arthur

I understand. It is a conversation I would not look forward to having, as well.
If possible, try to make the emphasis on how you want to hear his ideas and acknowledge his willingness to participate in class. State how you want to see him succeed by demonstrating a developmental growth in his communication skills which recognizes how one communicates differently in different environments, and he is able to successfully demonstrate how one communicates in an academic classroom environment.

If he advocates to continue participating in a disruptive manner, maybe you can ask him, "Why do you feel you need to participate in a disruptive and discourteous manner in the classroom?"

If you think this isn't too contentious, maybe you can ask him, "Why do you think others in the class interpret your communication style as disruptive and disrespectful, as mentioned in their reflection assignments?" (You may or may not want to ask this. Or maybe there is a better way to ask this.)


This student perceives themself or aims to be a "George Carlin" type (as they mentioned to you). If this student claims this is how he expresses himself and uses it as an excuse for freedom of expression or academic freedom, it may be a good opportunity to explore how one communicates differently in various environments. While comedy is an excellent tool to explore ideas and events, it is a different environment. The college academic classroom promotes a respectful exchange of ideas for all. Ask him how he can express his thoughts and ask questions to promote a continued and positive exploration. Remind him how the classroom is open to various viewpoints, including challenging content and contradictory viewpoints, but the goal is not to entertain, shock, disrupt, heckle, or end the discussion ... or to "be right" and win an argument. One can challenge content or ask about challenging content. One should communicate various viewpoints as a positive contribution to the class, though. I remind students that instructors and other students often raise ideas that they don't believe or is opposite of their opinion as a way to explore topics, but they still engage with an aim to positively explore the idea.

** from minju

- tell him that he is disruptive to your ability to teach bc he is not being reflexive about his position as a student
- that other students might find him entertaining, but that it is not generative or constructive as a learning model
- but you are the instructor and you are not in the game to please
- behavior - in class, that this is a learning environment and that he needs to respect that
- expectations - how do to assignments moving forward
- and then log it, so that you have a record of it

- keep your door open if he wants to talk to you about his things, so that you're not shutting him down - but he cannot be disruptive anymore

- solutions - tell him what's been going on, and what needs to change (including his behavior); and that, moving forward, if he has issues about his grades or the style of your teaching or things about you, he can go to you


- he can say, these are things that i disagree with
- but not dismiss things out of hand
- it disrupts other students from being able to have ideas of their own.

- making fun of things is also very dismissive

- its bullying behavior

- in the language of corporations, students need to feel invested in the class's content and environment of learning
- and this kid sounds intensely not interested in other people's perspectives

- i haev students read about unwellness at the beginning of each semester, if that's helpful

spark believes that US dominance is based on US nuclear power.

people's tribunal is part of program to challenge US-led world order based on their nuclear power

prof jang hae lee (int'l law prof) recognized that this is a challenge to the san francisco regime (understanding among nuclear powers after the san francisco treaty)

vision for successful outcome is to get a decision

SCHEDULED: <2022-04-11 Mon>
I have some gift books in your area that I would like for you to review to see if we should add them or not. Could you please come take a look at them at your earliest convenience? There are also a bunch of old reports that were sent to me for repair that might merit another look now that we are weeding.

I can leave them outside of my office with your name on it.

Some are things Rita wanted to keep/repair but I am not sure and they’re in bad condition so I think it might be worth another look.

Some are from a gift. These are primarily reports from various city agencies and some on philanthropic topics. I think they might be old enough not to be online. I have mixed feelings on these primarily because I am not sure anyone will go looking for them unless they are doing really in-depth research where having access to these primary documents might be useful. But also, Marxe has really expanded and maybe that’s the kind of thing they need to support their new program and faculty.

Also, if you don’t finish or have questions you want to chat about after you have looked at them, we can do that.

I hope this helps! Thanks again.

- faculty contract -- anything you make is yours

- however if you generate a curriculum / class....if money is involved in curriculum creation. materials you generate for your course will be retained by you

- if you're paid a specific fee for generation of materials, then it's maybe not yours.
